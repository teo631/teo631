        <h1 class="articleTitle">Welcome to my website!</h1>

        <p class="articleParag">
            Hello there, this is the website I have created as my "portfolio" but it has been long since it was 
            repurpesed to be a personal blog where I vent my frustrations and share my (failed) projects. I try to publish new 
            posts as often as I can.
            You can start browsing by checking <a href="myProjects.html?type=cards" >my projects</a> or <a href="myProjects.html?type=blogs" >my blog</a>.
            <br>
            <br>
            As for myself I don't have much to say. Oh wait I got an idea to intruduce myself; "Please tell us your name and 3 cool things about you."
            <br>
            <br>
            As an insentive to dig deeper in this website I am not going to hand out my name, you can find it if you read thru a few posts, you probly know me in person anyways.
            <br><br>
            Fact 1: I enjoy learning about inner workings/physics of motorvehicles. Also no I don't know how they work in and out but prob hold more info thn your average person does.
            <br>
            Fact 2: No, I don't dream on pursuing a carrer related to IT. 
            <br>
            Fact 3: I have written this website from scratch(besides a few lines where Chat-GPT realy helped me [i have no clue on how to fetch a json]). All posts are written by hand (w/ love)
            all of the projects here are mine.

            <br><br>
            BONUS FACT!!!: You can change the website theme by tapping on the car icon located on the top left of the screen. My personal fav is the deafult and the white/pink/black theme.
            Seriosly tho that color pallete is seriosly underrated imo. It has pink in it but doesn't feel gay at the slightest.
