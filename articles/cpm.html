    Idea of the project
</h1>

<p class="articleParag">
    This game was a project of a idea I had in summer of 2022 while thinking what type of games are the most popular
    , it was my first try at a proper game in unity, I think I have 
    created what I had in my mind accuratly.

<h1 class="articleTitle">The gameplay</h1>

<p class="articleParag" >
    The objective in game was pretty basic, match your cars model, 
    material and color and don't crash into obsticlas.You could also buy boxes and open them to get a random
    rim ,there are total of 15 rims 1 unlocked by deafult. Here is video of it:

<h1 class="articleTitle">The futures/development of the game</h1>

<p class="articleParag" >
    So here is the techincal part, the game had 5 cars, all modeled by me inspired after real 
    cars, a Lamborghini, a Buggati,a Mustang , a Porche and a Golf. The things that was realy difficult that I got from the 
    internet was the shader, SFXs and music of the pearlecant paint. Also I did add ads if the game blows in TikTok or something (it didn't) 
    so I can advirtise game on other platforms, you can trigger an ad by switching between menus, and crashing also you can watch an ad to
    skip a level or double the reward cash in a level. The only 2 things I am not happy about the project is the level amount,it's only 25 if you finish all of them game will 
    start you from level 1 saying it's level 26 the other thing is the controls, people i have made test the game often got confused about them expecting car to 
    follow their finger but the actual cotrols are hold right steer right and vice versa.

<h1 class="articleTitle">The feedback I got from people</h1>

<p class="articleParag" >
    The 2 main negative feedback I have gotten from people is that the game is too hard and the controlls are confusing
    <br>
    To be hones I find the game not to be that hard but I am the one making it I gues and about the controls as I have said about the controls in the techincal stuff part people expect the car to steer towards their finger but the controls arent like that
