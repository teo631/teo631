<h1 class="articleTitle">HEEEY!!!</h1>
<p class="articleParag">
I am actualy very happy to greet you here today right now as my fingertips are hitting my dusty office keyboard. Recently 
stuff has been rather "strange" as my emotions flactuated inbetween this post & the last "small" update post. Also I have 
been busy with some other stuff some I enjoyed doing some I didn't. I still have stuff do get done but it is either 
academical or a personal project. I don't know how long this post will be but still, I am going to commit into it because 
I don't care! This is my place not yours. What am I, your personal buffoon?
<br>
<br>
Actualy don't know where to start from, let's make the opening with a topic that has realy been bothering me.
</p>
<h1 class="articleTitle">Japanese arcade racing cabinet.</h1>
<p class="articleParag">
    So recently I have gone out to hangout with my friends, and one of the places we went was the local arcade. I used 
    to love that place, used to play Blur splitscreen on the ps3s with dad, sad that the ps3s are replaced by ps4s and ps5s.
    Anyways, I thought "Man wtf are we gona do here it is mostly unfair games for kids that are rigged to rob your coins off 
    you." Than my I saw it. AN JAPANESE RACING GAME CABINET WITH MOSTLY SIM HANDLING?????? OMG IT EVEN GOT FORCE FEEDBACKKKKK. AAAAAAAAAAAA.
    Spent quite a lot of money in a short span of time. No regrets tho. It is extreamly fun. I am going to play it today 
    with the leftover coins from years ago I have at home.

<h1 class="articleTitle">Big anouncment! Big website expension coming soon.</h1>
<p class="articleParag">
    Think of this expension as the "deep waters of the iceberg"(kinda like a personal forum where I only let in the poeple I want). No easy accses, no filters. But I don't 
    know what to name it. For those who wonder(nobody) I am using the usual css+javascript+html for the front end, and 
    Python+Flask fort he backend. I have menaged to create a secure login procces with hashed+salted passwords, but there 
    is one big problem. What do I name the website? Should I name it something edgy, or maybe not name it at all.
    I have been thinking of the name "offBeat"
    because of it sounding cool and edgy whilst also carying a nice meaning. You know I suck at spontenious stuff, music 
    is one of them. I even failed at the music exam(yes thats a thing) because I failed to sing and display the beat 
    of a piece with my hands so the name offBeat realy fits for those who feel the same way also it kinda sounds 
    similar to saying "off-grid" which is also correct as that place won't be your convetional website.

<br>
    Let me know your thoughts.

    <i>"It's not a fashion statement, it's a fucking deathwish.</i>
    <br>
    <br>
    Idk. I like bright & alive colors. Who died, why is everyone wearing black? Btw my favorite color is orange. I like to 
    dress sporty. If you see me wearing black it is prob forced. Wearing all light colors make feel less constrained and 
    it helps me be a little less serious.

<h1 class="articleTitle">Topic 1: Difficulty of cominucating with some people(and myself).</h1>
<p class="articleParag">
    This is a topic that I have been condridicting myself on. Am I the problem? Or some people are dumb? OR is it 
    selfish and disrespectfull to evaulate a persons ability express thierselfs? Let's start with some bad offenders;
    <br>
    <br>
    EXHIBIT A: The teacher isn't here so the class is empty the phones are not locked this time so you are on your phone 
    playing a racing game alone in your desk whilst everybody is playing Brawl Stars. As one of your classmates pases you by
    he comments "Are fucking cars again?". What? No ,no ,no the translation is correct. It's not some wierd pun or change 
    of meaning because of the sentence being translated over a diffirent language. I am repaiting it in greate detail: 
    "Are you having sexual intercourse with cars again?". You may suggest that I am overreacting to this but this is just 
    the tip of the iceberg.   
    <br>
    <br>
    EXHIBIT B: I am sitting at my desk alone at my desk because I was trying to get something writing related done quick.
    As another classmate passes by me (note that I AM NOT AT A POINT OF CONFORT WHERE I CAN LET ANYTHING SLIDE AS I DO WITH A 
    REALY CLOSE FRIENDS THAT I HAVE KNOWN FOR YEARS) he says: "Hey Teo why are your hands shaking beacuse of you jerking off all the time?"
    ????? just go kys at this point.
    <br>
    <br>
    EXHIBIT C: 
    <br>
    <br>
    Okay there is this one specific person who's has been getting on my nerves. I don't know how to explain him here 
    because if I were to try you would think I am overexaggerate. He comes to you just says your name or something offensive including 
    sexual elemnts likely alongside
    it if he were trying to get your attention before initiating a conversation or stating something importent.
    <br>
    <br>
    I say "what?/Yes?"
    <br>
    <br>
    Sometimes he continues to say similar stuff or just laughs the way I say "Yes?" and fucks off. How do you even 
    state that the thing he is doing is straight up harresment. Even I get emberresd from the thoughts of it. It should be 
    realy pethatic your words having no real weight.
</p>
<h1 class="articleTitle">1.1 The inclusion of sexual elements and some other borderline elemnts in daily speech.</h1>
<p class="articleParag">
    The demographic I am mentioning here are the type of people from the exhibits above. Two of the three words that come out 
    of their mouths are about them fucking something or something fucking something. Even putting these into words are 
    disgusting. Some people contrubuted to this blog by creating art, inspiring me and motivating me thus 
    getting their names in a invisable hall of fame, but your name will stayx here and slowly fade away like an 
    unwanted stain. 
    <br>    <br>
    Seriosly tho. The words have lost their meaning. We are past the point of no return.
</p>
<h1 class="articleTitle">1.2 "and myself"</h1>
<p class="articleParag">
    This is like the third attempt of me trying to making entry for this topic because of it being <i>realy</i>. Let's start 
    with some honest critisim. I can be annoying and toxic time time, not knowing where to stop a joke etc. Sometimes I might 
    be too stubborn on my opinions on things, trying to force people to my likings etc. Well you can realy see that 
    all of these realy lead to my infameous "not being able to market myself" trait. Another major thing is that I am 
    not realy good at not expressing but conveying emotions to other people (expression being unconscious and conveying being conscious transmition of emotions to the other party).
    You know the awkerd pause when you don't know what to reply to an playfull joke. Or even just to a friendly simple "how are you?".
    <br>
    <br>
    Also one thing that I want to state is that I am not gay, I am as straight as quarter mile dragstrip gets.
    <br>
    <br>
    Dude when I was looking what showed up when you looked "dragstrip". And in the entry for drag racing in wikipedia I found this:<br>
    <Img style="padding: 25px   ; height: 128px;" src="/resimler/drag.png"></Img>
    <br>
    "Funny car" huh. That put a smile on my face, thanks to whoever wrote that. Idk if thats an actual drag racing slang or something tho.
</p>
<h1 class="articleTitle">Sketching once again</h1>
<p class="articleParag">
    So recently I got my hands on a thin metal string that you can bend. Instantly had the idea to incorprate into a 
    sketch. My first idea was to make a barbed wire bat and make it smash of of them. The fracture from the blunt mixed in 
    with scars and lacerations left from the barbed wire could be a realy cool idea. But the idea fell into the water
    fairly quickly because the metal string would tear the paper since the bat would be narrow. So I thought. You have one of them 
    in your hand, and some wire on the other. What would you do? Shut that annoying mf up! So did I!
