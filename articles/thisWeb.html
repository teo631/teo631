<h1 class="articleTitle">Idea of the Project</h1>
<p class="articleParag">I realy wated to unify all my major projects to one place, also wanted to have a place to post
rants, game reviews etc.</p>
<h1 class="articleTitle">Development (+Explination how it works)</h1>
<p class="articleParag">The base of the site was realy easy to build ,code and do the css.
    The real time consuming part was to actualy write the "articles".

    <br>
    <br>

    First I thought of  creating a separete html page for each project obiusly this is not the correct thing to do
    so I did some thinking and dicaded to only have one html page that loads a bare html from a text file into a div.
    You are on that html page right now. Each article has an id for eg this articles id is "thisWeb" you can see it on the 
    url bar on top. Here is <a href="articles/thisWeb.html">a link to the barebone version of this article</a>. And the "my projects"
    page works by looping thru a json which has small arrays that contaion info about the project (title, description etc.).
    
    <br>
    <br>
    I also thinked about adding ads here, I even had how I would handle it planned 
    (put an empty object with a specific in any point of an article then replace it with an ad iframe) ,but thought 
    it wasn't worth the clutter + I hate ads.
    <br>
    <br>
    (Also don't mind the ads in Car Paint Masters ,that game was ment to be a annoying hypercasual game.)

<h1 class="articleTitle">Update as of the first 3/5 year(I think?) of this website!</h1>
<p class="articleParag">
    So this place has helped me a lot in terms of my overall mental state I can not imagine what I would have done if 
    this page didn't exists. Why did I just talk like I randomly found this website on the ground? I made it from the ground up.I truely appreciate my greate accomplisment.
    Anyways this place kinda feels like a public fork of a diary even tho I made it to be a portfolio like place.It is realy interesting if you ask me.
