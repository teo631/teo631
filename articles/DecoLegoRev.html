    Hey it is me, back again with another post about silly lego creations.
</p>

<h1 class="articleTitle">Brief of the decorative six-gun:</h1>
<p class="articleParag">
    The gimmick of this one is that it is a revolver with an actual rotating cylender and a semi-functional hammer. You cock the hammer 
    to make the cylender able to open to the side.
    <br>
    <br>
    Please note that I am facing a shortage of spare parts as you can see from the decrese on structural entegrity and lack of great visual design
    compared to the other two weapons developed before this one.
</p>

<h1 class="articleTitle">How to release the cylender to the side:</h1>
<p class="articleParag">
    First grip the gun from the handle, if you think that your movements are gentle and that it wouldn't bother you if that thing 
    didn't snap in half and splatter all across the room whilst using it you can grip it with a singular hand. If otherwise two hand grip is reccomended. 
    The front portion of the weapon allows for a good grip from your less dominant hand.
<br>
<br>
    After deciding which grip method to use:
    <br>    <br>

    1. You pull the hammer down with your dominant hands thumb.
    2. Tilt the gun to the left 
    3. Relase the hammer
    4. do your wildwest shanigans with the cylender.
    5. Pull the hammer down again.
    6. Tilt the gun to the right.
    7. Release the hammer to secure the cylender in place.

    <b>DISCLAIMER: This is not how actual double/single action revolvers work. Don't try to use an actual one the way it is shown here.
