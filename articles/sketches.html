    hi

<p class="articleParag">
    I realy appricate your great efforts and the great knowledge that is required to wander into 
    this page in order to see my shitty sketches.
    <br>
    <br>
    SO, first off all you may be surprised, even in a slight shock, by the tones of these amalgamation of 
    dots gives off. This is a rare case where I did realy wonder off my comfort zone in order to share them.

<p>
<h1 class="articleTitle">
    The reasoning
</h1>
<p class="articleParag">
    Okay let's get into the real question that has been itching your mind for a while. Why are these so 
    foreign to work that I usualy do? Because I wanted to try something diffrent. Didn't want walls of 
    text without any toppings, you get what I mean right? These guys provide a great shock value 
    to whoever comes accros them.
    One other major reasoning behind this is that 
    I just want to yapp here. Nothing is more relaxing than explaining a bizzare topic that nobody cares 
    whilst yapping about recent events with music on the background.

    The meaning

<p class="articleParag">
    These sketches are beutiful imo. Rough, torn and bold. Random fractures and deformations alongside
    with some artifical influences make them realy unsettling. Not to mention the abruptly crossed out text adding the 
    seasoning. 
    Also tried taking pictures with two 
    diffirent lighting conditions; Warm and cold. The cold ones does go realy hard imo. I even have a <i>"secret"</i> way to verify ownership of the sketches.

    I have gone out of my way to even "steal" some other peoples sketches. 
    I don't know if you actualy care or not but I do think that I have the rights to share it 
    if you have drawn it on my notebook. However I am still willing to cooporate if you like see this 
    section of the post removed or adjusted. I could even return the picture physicly if you want so.
    <br>
    <br>
    I do appriciate your not so intentional yet big contrubution to this great website tho.

    A bird, it does realy help make the tone of this post softer. You know what? 
    I am now going to research the meaning 
    of birds in art.
    <br>
    <br>
    Well, according to street art museum of amsterdam: 
    <br>
    <br>
    <i>"Birds in art represent a range of ideas including freedom, nobility, fertility, and bravery just to name a few. Figures of birds are often used to symbolize the poet or musician, are considered omens both for good and ill, and are sometimes thought to be the messengers of the gods."</i>
    <br>
    <br>
    Messengers of god, a symbol of freedom or maybe even an poet or musician. I wonder what was the artist of this 
    artpiece targeting to symbolize with this one taking into the <i>bizzarenes</i> of the other sketches found on 
    the same sheet of paper.
