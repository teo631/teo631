<p class="articleParag">
    I realy appricate your great efforts and the great knowledge that is required to wander into 
    this page in order to see my shitty sketches.
    <br>
    <br>
    I don't know where I mentioned it ,or did I mention it at all OR did I delete the post that contained the info in question, 
    but do you remember the game that I would be making that "make your legs feel burn*". Well I thought more into 
    that and said I would start by deciding the games art direction. Also will prob use this as assets on the 
    "undisclosed project" that I have going on rn.
    <br>
    <br>
    You know I can actualy do stuff when I feel passionate about doing so. Here are the results:
    <br>
    <br>
    I think I realy maneged to capture a unsettling vibe realy well, even added some text for extra sense of disturbence.
    Also my phone camera messed with the colors for no
    reason  
    which did realy help with the bold and burtal apperance of the pics. One critisim you could have with me is that I realy 
    pulled an edgelord on these. Not realy proud just wanted to expriement.Don't forget to check for updates on more sketches.

    *i don't know if other people get this feeling but I do get a slight burn feeling in my legs when I panic.

    I have gone out of my way to even "steal" some other peoples sketches. 
    I don't know if you actualy care or not but I do think that I have the rights to share it 
    if have drawn it on my notebook. However I am still willing to cooporate if you like see this 
    section of the post removed. I could even return the picture physicly if you want so.
