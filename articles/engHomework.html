    hey

<p class="articleParag">
    Gues who is back with more than enough thoughts to debate against ... Against what? Idk, myself? Other people?
    People don't even check here since it is boring for those who don't get the appel of such place like this. Maybe 
    it is better of unknown. Realy I don't think <i>anybody</i> have actualy sit and read all of the text here from 
    start to bottom with care. Am I wierd for expecting people to do so? This link is only atteched to my Instangram bio
    afterall. I don't promote it to people not counting the rare instances where I meantion that I have a website.
    <br>
    <br>
    But I digress.
    <br>
    <br>
    So.... main topic of this post my English homework. You may ask what it is and your answer would be that it 
    is something pretty retarded I would say, you have to explain/present an image. Wow I do that all the time here.
    Actualy this is like the MOST matching assigment on stuff that I have been doing recently.

<h1 class="articleTitle">
    The problem
</h1>
<p class="articleParag">
    I don't know. I actualy don't know what to present to my belowed class. I have no current interrest in anything 
    realy. I could present a render of one of the cars that I have modeled. But think about it. Isn't that wierd?
    Shouldn't I be proud of my own creations? How about.. How about? I don't know. I do not know. It feels like
    anything I have intrest is not accepted by my peers(and by myself). Okay let's make some pitches using some of the 
    things I have done recently as subjects.
</p>

<h1 class="articleTitle">
    PITCH 1: CAR RENDER
</h1>
<p class="articleParag">
    <img style="width: 256px;" src="resimler/rende_cool2.png">
    <br>
    <br>
    <i>"So this is one of the cars I have modeled for my (dead) project. The car is modeled after ``Trion Nemesis``
        a American hypercar first debuted at The Silicon Valley Auto Show. I have used blender to model the car base.
        Things that I like about this car are the active spoiler and how to rear end of the vehicle appers to the eye.
        How well the exhaust pipe is integrated into the taillights looping path. Also about the livery; I thought that the 
        purple fading to black to contrast the lightning decals on both sides look realy sleek and natural. 
    </i>
    <br>
    <br>
    Just realised that this isn't a good idea.
</p>
<h1 class="articleTitle">
    PITCH 2: "THIS" GUY
</h1>
<p class="articleParag">
    Well even tho this pitch is dead on arrival <i><a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fRs0OqV4uSc"> (Ba dum tss!)</a></i> I will still present it here. 
    (Dude that joke I made a moment ago realy made me smirk, I have got something wrong with me lmao.) Btw this piece 
    is from one of the layers below where you are right now. There are more where it comes from.
    <br>
    <br>
    <Img style="padding: 25px   ; height: 256px;" src="https://i.ibb.co/z5N6p3M/s8.jpg"></Img>  
    <br>
    <br>
    <i>
    "Okay let's start from top to bottom... 
    As the first thing that might have caught your eye is the fracture on the top left 
    portion of the skull which is exposing a blade of some sorts. It also appears to be dripping a liquid, likely blood in 
    context of the image. The matter that the blade was used is not known, however it did deffinetly hurt something/somebody. 
    Also I want to draw attention to the Zygomatic Bone where the luqid forms a veiny pattern greatly implying that the 
    liquid is pouring down then dripping from the jaw to the ground. A fairly cool and gruesome detail if you ask me.
    Okay lets take a look into another element; The nose. Aww look it is a heart. 
    It even has got some cracks around it leading to the eyesockets! One part I also want to draw attention to 
    is the mouth. Broken jaw, uneven teeth. I actualy don't pay attantion whilst drawing the teeth; that might be 
    the reason why it looks so messed up and natural.Because I think that the way into perfection is imperfection. Oh I forgat the most importent part: the eye<s>s</s>, they aren't 
    actualy there. I have just put them (it) so the drawing looks hostile instead off looking vulnerable. It also makes the whole drawing appear more human.  
    As the last note and my closing statement: The dressing on the right eye is a kind of yellow tape that I also have on my bike."
    </i>
    <br>
    <br>
    Same case as the above one. No one cares. Isn't intresting. Maybe a bit wierd at some parts would probably get locked 
    in an asylum if I were to present this one in class. Anyways keep your mask on.
    <br>
    <br>
    dudeeeee the paragraph above is realy REALY fire if you ask me. To bad I can't show it to anybody without it being awkerd.
</p>
<p class="articleParag">
    Thats right. <br>
    My true passion isn't right. <br>
    I've become an frighthened wright. <br>
    Holy shit I accidently rhymed.<br>

    <br><br>
    Well... I wasn't expecting that. Does that count as poetry? <s>It is not like anything nice ever happened recently.
    This is pure coincidence,</s> couldn't let it slide tho. Anyways back to the actual topic again. 

    Two things I have been passionate about didn't realy work out. They kinda did but not in the means that would 
    be considered as "normal". I am truly something of diffrent caliber. Remember, you would have multiple broken portions at your skull if you were to fire a 50bmg from a 9mm barrel whilst trying to shoot a bird.
    (Just got an idea for an sketch :3).
</p>
<h1 class="articleTitle">
    DAY 2: What did people present?
</h1>
<p class="articleParag">
    Today two people at class presented their "moments" in class. The first person <i>tried</i> to present a book but 
    tried reading from a pre-written paragrapgh which isn't allowed. The second person presented an painting called 
    "The Bedroom" painted by Van Gogh. She talked about what the painting and its color ment etc. So What did I learn
    from those presentations? I learnt that the two pitches I have presented here could get a pass considering the 
    vocablry used in them is far beyond what is spoken around in class. This task looks like a piece of cake after all.
    Gonna do some sketches I have formed some good thoughts at the back of my mind >:3.
</p>
<h1 class="articleTitle">
    ALSO FEW DAYS LATER:
</h1>
<p class="articleParag">
    <br>
    <br>
    (Trying to not turn another innocent post into a trauma dump session that you would normaly have with a therapist challange (IMPOSSIBLE)(GONE WRONG)(COPS CALLED))
    <br>
    <br>
    Okay... idk. What should I do? I got a silly idea. I will create a bingo card with stuff on it that I think will 
    get presented. Will be funny filling it out with a friend. Also this homeworkd made me think about the current state 
    of "what are other people chasing/doing". I don't know how to put this into words but the envy of most people 
    is just relating to certain things. You know romanticizing the "nuisance" of the current day. I don't know 
    if I am the bad actor/offender here but this unhealthy way of being inspired does bleed into expectations that 
    set up for thierself. One other thing that has been bothering me recently is the feeling(s) that I get from a 
    lack of admiration or the self-gratification that is provided by the work I do. I mean I can't expect people to 
    just be amazed by the stuff I do that is realy selfish. So what that does is ,it puts me in an unhealthy cycle of 
    chasing admiration from peers or grown ups. This is worsened by my lack of ability to work as a group. There were 
    a few instances where I had to do IT projects as a team; I either get my nose into other peoples tasks and 
    unintentionaly cancel thier role in team because I belive that my way of doing things is better
    or reduce it to a point where I am just doing the task instead of them (and thats realy mean) OR I put myself 
    in a state of constant panic whilst suffering heavly from Imposter Syndrom because I am working with people 
    who are more exprienced than me or people whom I made promises to. As most of my problems this stream of water 
    also leads to my issiu of not being able to market myself or seek proper connection.
    <br>
    <br>
    Before I go one other thing that I want to touch is the lack of my peers creating stuff from the ground up or the
    usage of "services" to do stuff. Let me put this thought into words in a diffrent way; How tf some people live without creating 
    something tangible? How? Like what do u do all day??? If you were to erase all my current knowladge on creating the 
    stuff I usualy do I would go <u>batshit insane</u>,<i>like</i> clinical depression levels of bad. My brand new hobby 
    would become doom-scrolling on mass-brain-rotting-short-form-content-distrubtion-networks(a.k.a. "socail media"). 
    You(not necesserly you,the person reading this, just <i>some other</i> people) sometimes make fun of shit I do. 
    I do realy want to feel something you call real. Anyways I am straying too far away from my original argument. 
    <br>
    <br>
    Okay straight into point this time. I don't find workig off somebody elses work without having understanding of it 
    not thrilling, or even worse doing something that "destroys" instead of outputting something tangible is irritating to me.
    I don't know what is irritating to me OR why is it. Maybe I just hate myself.
    <br>
    <br>
    I even got quote to put here which sends a message with a similar vibe to what I mean here.
    <br>
    <br>
    <i>"You smash it, we'll build around it."</i>
    <br>
    <br>
    hey, I found another quote by some guy called "Franz Kafka"
    <br>
    <br>
    <i>People label themselves with all sorts of adjectives. I can only pronounce myself as 'nauseatingly miserable beyond repair</i>
    <br>
    <br>
    And some guy commented this to somebody asking for explanation of the quote: <i>"Just speaks to how abuse and mistreatment erodes your sense of self until you really do only identify with the pain you’re forced to feel."</i>
    <br>
    <br>
    Ain't it a big coincidence that I ran into a quote that puts a finger <i>right</i> into something that I have been 
    speaking about? AND the fact that a random stranger on the internet was generous enough to explain it in clear detail which realy helps to pinpoint the thing I am tryin to say.
    <br>
    <br>
    I do infact feel like I am being violated being forced to write copied essays from the internet after writing these 
    posts with passion.
