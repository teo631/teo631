    hey

<p class="articleParag">
    Gues who is back with more than enough thoughts to debate against ... Against what? Idk, myself? Other people?
    People don't even check here since it is boring for those who don't get the appel of such place like this. Maybe 
    it is better of unknown. Realy I don't think <i>anybody</i> have actualy sit and read all of the text here from 
    start to bottom with care. Am I wierd for expecting people to do so? This link is only atteched to my Instangram bio
    afterall. I don't promote it to people not counting the rare instances where I meantion that I have a website.
    <br>
    <br>
    But I digress.
    <br>
    <br>
    So.... main topic of this post my English homework. You may ask what it is and your answer would be that it 
    is something pretty retarded I would say, you have to explain/present an image. Wow I do that all the time here.
    Actualy this is like the MOST matching assigment on stuff that I have been doing recently.

<h1 class="articleTitle">
    The problem
</h1>
<p class="articleParag">
    I don't know. I actualy don't know what to present to my belowed class. I have no current interrest in anything 
    realy. I could present a render of one of the cars that I have modeled. But think about it. Isn't that wierd?
    Shouldn't I be proud of my own creations? How about.. How about? I don't know. I do not know. It feels like
    anything I have intrest is not accepted by my peers(and by myself). Okay let's make some pitches using some of the 
    things I have done recently as subjects.
</p>

<h1 class="articleTitle">
    PITCH 1: CAR RENDER
</h1>
<p class="articleParag">

    <br>
    <i>"So this is one of the cars I have modeled for my (dead) project. The car is modeled after ``Trion Nemesis``
        a American hypercar first debuted at The Silicon Valley Auto Show. I have used blender to model the car base.
        Things that I like about this car are the active spoiler and how to rear end of the vehicle appers to the eye.
        How well the exhaust pipe is integrated into the taillights looping path. Also about the livery; I thought that the 
        purple fading to black to contrast the lightning decals on both sides look realy sleek and natural. 
    </i>
    <br>
    <br>
    Just realised that this isn't a good idea.

<h1 class="articleTitle">
    PITCH 2: "THIS" GUY
</h1>
<p class="articleParag">
    Well even tho this pitch is dead on arrival <i><a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fRs0OqV4uSc"> (Ba dum tss!)</a></i> I will still present it here. 
    (Dude that joke I made a moment ago realy made me smirk, I have got something wrong with me lmao.) Btw this piece 
    is from one of the layers below where you are right now. There are more where it comes from.

    <br>
    <i>
    "Okay let's start from top to bottom... 
    As the first thing that might have caught your eye is the fracture on the top left 
    portion of the skull which is exposing a blade of some sorts. It also appears to be dripping a liquid, likely blood in 
    context of the image. The matter that the blade was used is not known, however it did deffinetly hurt something/somebody. 
    Also I want to draw attention to the Zygomatic Bone where the luqid forms a veiny pattern greatly implying that the 
    liquid is pouring down then dripping from the jaw to the ground. A fairly cool and gruesome detail if you ask me.
    Okay lets take a look into another element; The nose. Aww look it is a heart. 
    It even has got some cracks around it leading to the eyesockets! One part I also want to draw attention to 
    is the mouth. Broken jaw, uneven teeth. I actualy don't pay attantion whilst drawing the teeth; that might be 
    the reason why it looks so messed up and natural.Because I think that the way into perfection is imperfection. Oh I forgat the most importent part: the eye<s>s</s>, they aren't 
    actualy there. I have just put them (it) so the drawing looks hostile instead off looking vulnerable. It also makes the whole drawing appear more human.  
    As the last note and my closing statement: The dressing on the right eye is a kind of yellow tape that I also have on my bike."

    <br>
    Same case as the above one. No one cares. Isn't intresting. Maybe a bit wierd at some parts would probably get locked 
    in an asylum if I were to present this one in class. Anyways keep your mask on.
    <br>
    <br>
    dudeeeee the paragraph above is realy REALY fire if you ask me. To bad I can't show it to anybody without it being awkerd.

<h1 class="articleTitle">
    The contiunation of the "problem" part:
</h1>
<p class="articleParag">
    Thats right. <br>
    My true passion isn't right. <br>
    I've become an frighthened wright. <br>
    Holy shit I accidently rhymed.<br>

    <br><br>
    Well... I wasn't expecting that. Does that count as poetry? It is not like anything nice ever happened recently.
    This is pure coincidence, couldn't let it slide tho. Anyways back to the actual topic again. 

    Two things I have been passionet about didn't realy work out. They kinda did but not in the means that would 
    be considered as "normal". I am truly something of diffrent caliber. Remember, you would have multiple broken portions at your skull if you were to fire a 50bmg from a 9mm barrel whilst trying to shoot a bird.
    (Just got an idea for an sketch :3).
