<h1 class="articleTitle">Home made attempts at creating content a farm.</h1>
<p class="articleParag">
    This is a interesting one.
    One day I was scrolling thru youtube shorts and noticed a reaccuring pattern of videos that revolve arround reddit 
    stories sourced from post comments. And said to myself "Man I can automate this kind of stuff". 
    So I got to work. I was realy excited whilst learning neccesery compenents of the project. The development 
    a few days and was relativly easy to tackle.
</p>

<h1 class="articleTitle">Product 1: AUTOMATED REDDIT POST CONTENT FETCHER & EDITOR</h1>
<p class="articleParag">
    For this I used Python(also this was my first time exprience with python!). <a target="_blank" href="https://pypi.org/project/moviepy/">Selenium</a> for fetching/browsing and 
    <a target="_blank" href="https://pypi.org/project/moviepy/">moviepy</a> for video editing. 
    <br>
    <br>

    Here is the <a target="_blank" href="https://www.tiktok.com/@redditabi">page</a> that I posted the video to...
    <br>
    <br>
    ...and here is the script in work.
    <br>
    <iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/dblK2RqHOik?si=KIeyRMIcDM2QkARW" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen></iframe>
    <br>
    Here you can absorve it fetcihing the comments, generating the AI voice and then finishing it of by editing it in span of mere munites.
    <br>
    <br>
    As you can see the videos posted on the TikTok page got realy low amounts of interaction and views. They got around 150-200 views but on YouTube they 
    got 0. I think this was because of them being flagged for AI content or something similar to that. I think they 
    were flagged as AI at tiktok too but the all-mighty algorithm still serverd it.

<h1 class="articleTitle">Product 2: AUTOMATED STORY GENERATING+TELLING VIDEOS</h1>
<p class="articleParag">
    This was one was an afterthought and I created it knowing it wont achive much. The place I got the inspiration for
    this one is <a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=roblox+dizisi">shit Roblox storytime videos</a>. They looked pretty easy to replicate.
    So created a prompt to generate make CHAT-GPT generate dialoge revolving around the topics I provide. The I feed 
    the Python script that I wrote the text file. Then the script generates a video of ai voice narrating the story 
    and predetirmined character pictures popping op on the scene when one of the characters talk.

    <br>
    <br>
    But the best part of this one generating <b><i>bizzare</i></b> stories with my friends than laughing at them 
    for extended periods of time.
</p>
<h1 class="articleTitle">CONCLUSION</h1>
<p class="articleParag">
    Were these worth it? Yes.
    Also I have noticed TikTok can detect and shadow ban videos that include slightest bit of political content. Kinda creepy if you ask me.
    If you want source of these just contanct me.
</p>

<h1 class="articleTitle">small update</h1>
<p class="articleParag">
    Just saw some classmates on class watching a video where it prompts a word than you try to 
    find songs with such word in their title. That seems extreamly easy to replicate. Will take one this one 
    once I get some free time.
