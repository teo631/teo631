<h1 class="articleTitle">Hello how are you today?</h1>
<p class="articleParag">
    I sinceraly hope that you are all-well. Today I am again going to talk about many small topics that  
    I have accumulated in my mind over a great period of time, just like <a target="_blank" href="/article.html?project=smallUpdate">the first "small update" post</a>,
    since I have a few hours empty before I hit the sack.
    <br>
    <br>    
</p>

<h1 class="articleTitle">The new page/future "statuses"</h1>
<p class="articleParag">
    I had the idea of a future like this since I created the "blog" page. Sometimes I would just have 
    thoughts/updates on things that had nothing to do with anything and were too short to write a full on 
    blog post about. So I create the "statuses" page. I think I have re-invented twitter for personal use.
    I might even merge both pages together to simplyfy the site structure. 
</p>

<h1 class="articleTitle">Small thing about the content of the status updates.</h1>
<p class="articleParag">
I don't know but I feel do sometimes feel the urge to delete them. For eg. here me canceling out some 
posts I made:

<br>
<br>
"Well I managed to go thru all of the exams allthough I might have used techniques some might consider immoral."
<br>--Nobody cares about your exams dumbass, and mentioning that you cheated on them as "immoral techniques" is
 the most stupid thing I have ever hear. You should delete that post now.
<br>
<br>
"Hey gues who managed to clone a repo via bash today on his moms shitty laptop"
<br>
-- Oh okay gues who managed to learn how to write 2 lines of command on a terminal. Imagine going on 
a hardware store and bragging how you managed to use a screwdriver to screw a screw in place. Even a normie could do 
that. You should delete that post.
<br>
<br>
"``Time won't wait,I'll push to the limit, I won't waste a munite.`` üó£Ô∏èüó£Ô∏èüó£Ô∏èüî•" 
<br>
-- No one is going to get the reference.
<br>
<br>
See? I am almost too perfect at trashing myself to be ashamed of things I enjoy doing. You coud clasify 
these thoughs as "the voices" in head. This is  major contrubuting factor to me not being able to "market"
myself (I remember mentioning this aspect of me in a previous blog post however I don't remeber if I 
actualy deleted it or not.). I have a list of topics that I have gathered to write on here and these thoughts 
are pushing me to drop off half of the topics.

<br>

Edit: Just created <a href="/myProjects.html?type=sct">it :3</a>

<h1 class="articleTitle">1.0 Sleeping</h1>
<p class="articleParag">
    You heard me right, I will actualy talk about sleeping and my thoughts on it.
</p>
<h1 class="articleTitle">1.1 Sleep time balencing</h1>
<p class="articleParag">
    I remember having a realy good (I realy mean it) sleeping schedule at the start of this (school) year
    but when the first exam week started <i>something</i> happened and my sleep schedule got a bit messy.
    It was still not that bad tho, It went all downhill when the second exam week arrived which made it a 
    habit for me to stay up past 00.45 at earliest. The main effect this habit (bad or good) is that 
    I sometimes can wake up late in the morning (around 9-10-11) which I don't prefer since I like to 
    cycle around my neighborhood early in the morning.

    <br>
    <br>
    One major reason for me staying up late may be that I do sleep at school for around a hour average
    everyday.
</p>
<h1 class="articleTitle">1.2 Dreams</h1>
<p class="articleParag">
    <i>
        "Why do dreams dissipate upon waking,<br>
        before we're able enought to intake them?"<br>
    </i>
</p>
<h1 class="articleTitle">1.2.1 Dreams w/ positive attributes</h1>
<p class="articleParag">
    What kind of dreams do you like the most? This is a realy special question that I wish people asked
    me. As for the answer of that question; I like kind of dreams that take in remote(or realy barren) 
    locations that I know/been to. Stuff like my school, the local mall , the local hospital etc. I 
    do remember some dreams taking places in video game maps (de_nuke and city of lossantos), not in the 
    video game itself tho. I would %100 recreate the places that I have been in my dreams if I had the
    necesery photorealistic 3d modeling knowledge to do so.
    <br>
    <br>
    As for the events that take place in scuch dreams. Most of them are calming and sometimes do have 
    stressing minor elements besides that they are realy soothing. They sometimes do all include people 
    or figures with similar specialities.
    <br>
    <br>
    UPDATE: I actualy saw a dream today that you can clasify as one of these dreams! The location was 
    soothing and odd as always wish to see more like this one soon.
</p>
<h1 class="articleTitle">1.2.2 Dreams w/ neaturel/meaningless attributes</h1>
<p class="articleParag">
    These are the type of dreams that I have been seing primarly lately.The frequency 
    of these dreams are in direct coralition with my mood. I see more off these when I am upset/stressed. 
    They don't have any unordinary 
    elements unlike the "positive dreams". They mostly revolve around mundane set of events like 
    school etc. You could inculde day-dreaming in this cattogory. 
</p>
<h1 class="articleTitle">1.2.3 Dreams w/ negative attributes(Nightmares)</h1>
<p class="articleParag">
    It has actualy been a good while since I saw a proper nightmare the closest thing I have gotten to 
    that recently was a "sleep paralysis"  (I assume?) even at that the exprience wasn't that bad 
    there were no demons or anything just feeling like being locked beneth my blanket with random sensory(the ground shaking, flashling lights) stuff 
    going on. One notable thing is that I used to see a lot of nightmares about elevatrs as a kid since 
    I had a phobia of getting stuck in one of them.
</p>
<h1 class="articleTitle">CPM2 and the supposed website renavation</h1>
<p class="articleParag">
    I have been postponing these 2 for a while now I don't think that I will be able to take any action
    towards them since I don't have the free time/will to do so. I also have actauly forgat how the codebase 
    of CPM2 already works. And I doubt that the new color palette will actualy look good. I might actauly 
    get help from somebody that knows what they are doing/know well about color theory. Wish I realy knew someone
    like that.
</p>
<h1 class="articleTitle">TI2 being in death bed</h1>
<p class="articleParag"><i>
"Have you heard the news that you're dead?<br>
No one ever had much nice to say, <br>
I think they never liked you anyway<br>
Oh, take me from the hospital bed"<br>
<br>
<br>
</i>
We will get the defenitive answer of TI2 being dead by end of this mounth. And I higly doubt it is 
actualy going to get a green light from the jury. Might even orginize a "memorail event" for it.
This one realy upsets me. And people that I have talked about it before the tragic events of it being 
declined didn't realy do anything to give me morrals.(I mean it is not their fault but a genuine 
"Nice try man, it is sad that your hard work went to trash. We still think TI2 is cool and you should 
keep developing what you have passion for, also fuck the system too."
would be nice, whatever it is a tragidy after all as I said before.)
</p>
<h1 class="articleTitle">Sketching</h1>
<p class="articleParag">
    I have been sketching stuff lately and I find this place the perfect place to post them. One small isue 
    tho I am not sure how I am going digitilize them. I do have a photocopy machine at home , not sure 
    if that will do it tho.
    <br>
    <br>
    Another later edit: Hey it is me from a few days after finishing writing the post yet here I am still 
    writing on a 3(actualy 4 think if you consider the Midnight day skip thing) day old post because I am borad late at night.
    <br>
    <br>
    Layering content posted here in order to make raise the barrier for seing that content:
    <br>
    <br>
    I am thinking about this becase just plopping something people might consider bizzare on the 
    surfuce of this website is quite unsettling for me personaly. But layering that kind of content beneth 
    difficult places to reach may raise a few problems. Such as the content being hidden away from not so tech
    savy people who might have actualy admire the creation. I should take into count that not everyone is a 
    web crawling geek. As for the obfuscation methods I may use here are a few that just came out of my mind:
    Hiding images in the resource folder(can be accses via F12), hiding image urls in javascript files in the resources 
    (still aveilable thru f12 allthough requires a few extra steps.), encrypting the images using a simple 
    method, compressing the files via WinRar and destrubuting them (this wouldn't make it as hard to reach the 
    files compared to other methods I have mentioned.). Anyways there is still a good while until I publish those 
    sketches. I may be also overthinking this(this is likely the case).  
</p>
<h1 class="articleTitle">Special thanks to Github</h1>
<p class="articleParag">
    Big shoutouts to GitHun for providing all these free services that make it possiable+practical to 
    host this blog/""portfoli"" for absuletly free with NO MODERATION. I could say the most vile shit 
    you have ever heard in your life, call out whoever I want however I want and nobody can do anything 
    about it(idk if this is against tos of GitHub or not, "open source hate speech" ig ). This is the primary reason I use this place to share my thoughts instead of mainstream
    "social" media.
</p>

<h1 class="articleTitle">Socail media???</h1>
<p class="articleParag">
    Just had the idea to write this. Why is it called social media? The most social it gets is texting your friends
    You can already do that via sms, I gues the extra added future of being able to send your friends short form 
    content directly is a big pluss for ppl. Seriosly tho you don't realy share anything "social" there 
    you consume rather than learn you manufacturing rather than sharing. You can't realy commit into anything 
    big on those places unlike here. Good luck posting long morally indecisive paragraph on any of those sites.
</p>

<h1 class="articleTitle">State of the economy</h1>
<p class="articleParag">
    As far as I am clear it is pretty bad. With exchange rates of around 32tl:1$ I have lost sense of 
    how much stuff is actualy worth. Price tags flactuate every few weeks. When you go out with the largest 
    bill you have aveilable and you spend it on a cheap fastfood menu and a few snacks it feels like 
    you spent a lot of money but in reality you just spent $6.30. It does feel realy wierd.
    <br>
    <br>
    Enough for today I am going to keep writing tomorrow. Gn.

<h1 class="articleTitle">Heaven:x:Hell</h1>
<p class="articleParag">
    As you might have heard recently Sum 41 has made thier last relaise as a double album. 
    One side representin a lighter and more pop punk vibe(Underclass hero,30mins of power,All killer no filler etc) as the "Heaven" name suggests on the flip side 
    there is "Hell" consisting of heavier metal/rock themes (order in decline,13 voices,Screaming bloody murder).
    Both of the albums are greate and both sound like Sum41 however my personel choise is the hell side (üëø)
    (Rise up, Stranger In times,House of liars,Paint it black ,It's all me , etc these all go pretty hard).
    It is not that Heaven side is bad or anything I just find the other side more energetic and more meaningfull
    If you enjoy mainstream music you might enjoy the "Heaven" side more. They realy maneged to go out with a bang.
</p>

<h1 class="articleTitle">The local elections are over!</h1>
<p class="articleParag">
    And the ugly faces of those politicians are gone off the streets! No more stupid busses causing 
    noise pollition. No more boring political adverts creating life threatining blind spots on intersections!
    And I highly doubt I will see any change in near future that actualy solves lasting problems with 
    the city. There is still dameged and stripped out apartments in the middle of the city just casualy 
    staying there with all the rubble/trash still in them.
</p>

<h1 class="articleTitle">C&B Tech F1 team</h1>
<p class="articleParag">
    Wait what? Who are C&B tech? A F1 team? what?
    You heard me right me and my friend are actualy going to form a F1 team. 
    I will make the liveries and the uniforms for the team, they will be full of inside jokes and 
    references to many forms of media. You shouldn't have given players full creative freedom with the 
    liveries they upload :) . (The game is a mobile game called Monoposto 2024. btw it is free, my friend reccomanded me 
    the game. And also it doesn't have any necesery micro transactions.)  
    This inside joke (CBT) has realy evolved into something I am realy proud of. 
</p>

<h1 class="articleTitle">Later addition: Why not write here in my native?</h1>
<p class="articleParag">
    This one is a later addition to this post since I realy wanted to write about it but didn't want to create another 
    page soley for it.
    <br>
    <br>
    Reason 1: Globalization
    <br>
    <br>
    You know this place was supposed to be a portfolio before delving into a place where I (unprofasionaly)
    complain about frustrations I have on various topics. This website would be an absulute death-wish to 
    use as a portfolio for showcasing your stuff in a corporate manner as in its current state.
    <br>
    <br>
    Reason 2: Ease of verbalizing violent/borderline opinions.
    <br>
    <br>
    It is in fact easier to put out a statement in your non-native language since you can dissociate your morals 
    from the way you speak in your native in order to put out more radical speech.
    <br>
    <br>
    Reason 3:A higher barrier of entry
    <br>
    <br>
    Let me indriduce you to Bob; Bob can't take shit for serious when it is necesery to do so, Bob can't think from other peoples perspective for once, 
    Bob can't construct a sentence without incoprating a sexual joke/referenc because he is beating his dick 24/7, Bob doesn't know where to stop pushing a joke,
    Bob may be somebody that knows you know in person. Bob may exploit slight insecurities you expose here if he were ever to stumble open this page.
    But Bob can not bother to navigate content that isn't served to him via scrolling verticly. Bob isn't likely to comprehand 
    well thought and put together vocablry-rich sentences that the translator can not translate properly since he is also probly not very good at 
    speaking English, so he will just likely gloss over the surface 
    then fuck off without causing much inconvience. 
    <br>
    <br>
    I think these three excuses make a valid point for me to use "English" to write in here.
</p>

<h1 class="articleTitle">Can I pass myself off as an small "Author"?</h1>
<p class="articleParag">
According to wikipedia: "In legal discourse, an author is the creator of an original work, whether that work is in written, graphic, or recorded medium."
So infact I do count as an "Author" since this work you are observing is both original and written. WHICH makes me
<i>barely</i> elligible
to relate to the "People who read VS people who write" meme. hehe
</p>
