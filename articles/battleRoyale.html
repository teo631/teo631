<h1 class="articleTitle">Idea of the Project</h1>
<p class="articleParag">
    This games development started around summer of 2021 then paused then started again before summer of 2022.The idea was to
    have a pretty standert battle royale game with skills.

<h1 class="articleTitle">The Gameplay</h1>
<p class="articleParag">
    The gameplay is pretty simple there is no progression, when there were enough players the game started put all players
    in a state where they click where they click to a point where they can land on.After they land the player could loot houses
    and take cars from dealerships around the map. The map was not that large but it wasn't very small the map consisted of
    small towns and a lake.There were a good variety amount weapons and a few skills. The gameplay worked fine but it
    I couldn't get more than 5 players so the balancing is centered around 1v1 fights instead of a free-for-all warzone.

<h1 class="articleTitle">The Development</h1>
<p class="articleParag">
    This projects target was more about learning rather than making a full game.The most fun part about development was definetly 
    the gun modeling , creating the game logic and creating the map. The part I am not happy is that the weapon models arent that optimized.
