    long wait.

    You can switch inbetween them by tapping on the shitty 3d low poly car 
    located on the top right of your precious display.
    <br>
    <br>
    Here are brief explanations and my thoughts for each theme.

<h1 class="articleTitle">
    The "Night" theme.
</h1>
<p class="articleParag">
    The original theme with this website.It was quite a miracle me coming up with a actualy
    readable color 
    pallete first try after being inspired by a cozy color pellate.

<h1 class="articleTitle">
    Green-White-Black
</h1>
<p class="articleParag">
    Do you know the skyscraper you go to at the second chapter of Mirrors Edge(2008)? The colors of 
    that world realy amaze me. Wanted to pay tributes to it.

<h1 class="articleTitle">
    WHITE-BLACK-PINK
</h1>
<p class="articleParag">
"CALLING OUT LOUD WITH NO RESPECT ('SPECT)<br>
I'M NOT THE ONE, JUST ANOTHER REJECT ('JECT)<br>
I'M THE VOICE TO OFFEND ALL THOSE WHO PRETEND"<br>
üó£Ô∏èüî•üî•üî•

Besides the neash reference this one actualy turned out to be way cooler and more original than 
I expected for it to be. And it is actualy readable. One uniqe thing about this theme is that it doesn't feel gay 
at the slightes even tho it has pink as one of the primary colors.

<h1 class="articleTitle">
    WHITE-ORANGE-BLACK
</h1>
<p class="articleParag">
    Guess who likes orange. You could consider this to be objectivly difficult to read.
</p>
<h1 class="articleTitle">
    RED-WHITE
</h1>
<p class="articleParag">
    Elegant and bold, like a slap to your face(and you eyes).
</p>

    CONCLUSION
</h1>
<p class="articleParag">
    What did I conclude from finishing this task  after procrastination it for mounths? Well you tell 
    me, do you like these themes? DO YOU? It would be a real shame if you weren't to do so.
    This renovation is the only rewarding thing I have done for myself since I have gone out of town. I 
    have so many tasks pending waiting to be done yet I can't do any of them because I don't have the motivation 
    do so. You can't expect me to be happy when my routine looks like wakeUp->eat->study->game->sleep. 
    Seriosly thank you so much for ripping me away from plans I have been setting up, ripping me away from 
    holiday that I have been using as an excuse to bare thru difficult times.
     "Oh yeah he doesn't speak often BTW HE IS GONA BECOME A COMPUTER RELATED JOB LIKE HE DOES SHIT OR SOMETHING IDK LIKE ENGINEERS ASK HIM QUESTIONS HE IS SO GOOD AT COMPUTERS(I HAVE NO IDEA WHAT HE IS DOING NOR CARE LESS ABOUT IT I AM JUST USING THIS TO SATISFY MY EGO ON FAMILY GATHERINGS)". And after all of this frame it so that I am the guilty one for being ignorent,couldn't be more thankfull.
