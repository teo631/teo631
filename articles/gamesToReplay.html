<h1 class="articleTitle">Here with old friend; the silence, in the end.</h1>
<p class="articleParag">
    SOOOOOOO its ya boy here  once again, feeling a tid bit weepy down 
    (feeling cute might paint the ceiling in pitchfork-red this evening ðŸ¥°ðŸ¥°ðŸ¥°),
    getting emotianaly ready to write about geeky shit no1 gives a shit about 
    because I'm bored asf and have nothing better to do! So lets go.
    <br>
    <br>
    BRO MY LEFT EARBUD JUST FUCKING DIED AS OF ME WRITING THIS ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ fuck you life im actualy not writing this rn. See you a few days later.
    <br>
    <br>
    Anyways let's get into the actual topic, so let's say that one day I slip and hit my had on the sidewalk erasing
    the memory of the games I played. (hi it is me from 6 hours later, found a replacement for my old earbuds even tho 
    the current audio quality is dogshit).
    <br>
    <br>
    So here is the list of games I would deffinetly play again without a second thought. Starting the list with a 
    cult  classic (I'll try to be spoiler free)(* = spoiler):
</p>
<h1 class="articleTitle">Mirrors Edge (2008)</h1>
<p class="articleParag">
    Do I like the visuals of the game because it defines the type of style I like or I like the games visuals because 
    they resoneted well my with my unfullfilled desires? Idk. White + bold color with 2000s acrhitecture. The games 
    has warm/cold/inbetween places. For eg. I realy enjoy the early morning easthetics that the chapter "FLIGHT" has,
    the soothing music mixed with the haze of the horizon. I realy enjoyed the city. I am writting this while im away 
    from my home town, the place I am currently staying has similar acrhitecture even tho the colors aren't all blinding 
    white it does still resonate with the games easthetics. 
    <br>
    <br>
    One other chapter I want to talk about is the chapter where you first meet with the runner cops. The sunset is realy cool.
    <br>
    And for the final note of the aesthetics I realy fw the shard. I mean the part with yellow lightning and the vents
    is stunning (also the puzzle music is LIT).
    <br>
    <br>
    As for the gameplay, this game is realy uniqe on that aspect too. You have to play and finish the game first to understand 
    what I am saying but; there is two ways of playing this game. Playing and "playing ðŸ˜ˆ" . One you observe the scenery
    digest the music; on the other side of the coing you are side dashing thru alleys like a speed demon.
    <br>
    <br>
    The only negative thing I have abt this game is the combat, it is extreamly repetetive. And I think more content
    could be packed w/ the game idk I think that there is a lot of untapped potential in this concept.
</p>
<h1 class="articleTitle">Mirrors Edge: Catylist (2016)</h1>
<p class="articleParag">
    Bro I want to lick the glass panels at the rooftops of the buildings. The squeking F8's shoes makes as she runs of 
    them is just ðŸ˜©. I some people realy dislike the cyberpunk aesthetic but I am ok w/ it. Sometimes it does 
    feel wierd when the acrhitecture makes 0 sense. I gues this decision was made in order to create more layout
    opurtinities for a open world. But bro some districts just go so hard. Downtown, The view, and The Shard are all 
    just perfect. I do sometimes just stop and enjoy the scenery, also collecting all gridNodes is one of the most 
    soothing exprience I've had in gaming. 
    <br>
    <br>
    As for the gameplay, the movement of the first game is mostly better imo; like you actualy had to build momentum 
    instead of just pressing your mouse etc. Also I think that some missions could be done better. Most missions 
    take place inside linear seperate levels which idk just doesn't do it for me. 
    <br>
    <br>
    oooo the combat. I think this is wasted potential, still better compared to the first game but MAN it is still 
    repetetive. What they could have done is make it more like a platformer fighthing game. That could've made it more
    enjoyable imo.
    <br>
    ***MINOR SPOILER***: Wish that you would be the one bombing the mall instead of it being done offscreen. Still 
    cool explosion tho.(But is still kinda confusing, like you complete a random mission and 9/11 of Cascadia happens,
    realy wild shit.)
    <br> 
    <br>
    ALSO SOMEBODY GET ME THE GLASSES THAT ICARUS WEARS BRO PLEASE ðŸ˜«.  
    <br>
    <br>
    As for the closing part; waiting for affordable AR lenses with user-friendly devkits to come out. Ya boy is going to create the Beat.
</p>
<h1 class="articleTitle">DYING LIGHT 1</h1>
<p class="articleParag">
    I got this game for 15 Turkish Liras to play w/ friends and it was one of the best decisions I've made bro.
    Used to grind legend levels in summer; the feel of the air conditioner, the ambience music, the vibe that 
    Harran gives off. It was perfect. The story missions are fun and engaging, the mechanics are realy good too.
    Over all solid title would reccomand 10/10. 
    <br>
    <br>
    Man the atmosphere just slaps.
    <br>
    <br>
    The dlc was kinda mid tho why ditch free-running in favor of cars???
</p>
<h1 class="articleTitle">NFS: RIVALS</h1>
<p class="articleParag">
    First off all; Redview County is a beatifull. The lush forest, wavey coasts, isolate deserts, snowy mountins, 
    wide farmlands they all just click together.
    <br>
    <br>
    As for the gameplay, it is actualy cinamatic. Doing a heat 10 hot pursuit race in the thunderstorm at night 
    with a heli shining a blinding spotlight into your retinas is just 10/10. The sense of speed is great the handling
    fits the map the progression is fun most of the time.
    <br>
    <br>
    The multiplayer is kinda ify tho the player cap of lobbys need to be increased in order to make the game more action packed.
    Also don't know if it is fun w/ friends or not cuz I couldn't get any off my friends to buy it.
    <br>
    <br>
    Also the PC port has quite bit of jank so be prepared ig.
</p>
<h1 class="articleTitle">
    NFS: PRO STREET (pepega edition reccomanded btw)
</h1>
<p class="articleParag">
   No better feeling than carying your rocket ship Twingo-RS thru hairpins and flooring it on the straights.
   It's just perfect man. All the deciplins feel uniqe too. This game has generated so many autistic memes
   for meme (the nevada highway, MY MAN, Rc's 240SX, Battle machines, Willow springs etc. I could go on.)
   Also this one is realy great if you're into car culture.

    ENTRY POINT
</h1>
<p class="articleParag">
    First roblox game here; I mean such a cult classic. If you haven't played it already go play it rn.
    Dude this game goes extreamly hard like DAMMMM. Infiltrating the CSIS, Wargete, some banks? Count me in.
    This game provided me with hours of fun entertainment. Just go play it. Come back here once you have two level 
    75 operators for both loud and stealth. 
    <br><br>
    Ik this is going to sound wierd but I just loud up black dusk to just roam the sever/ventilation areas. 
    <br>
    <br>
    Also the I do realy find the way the levels decorated realy interesting. I mean there is very low amount of 
    details but it manages to convey a lot of detail and meaning. Realy goated stuff.
</p>
<h1 class="articleTitle">LUMBER TYCHOON 2</h1>
<p class="articleParag">
    This is just a calming game, go and chop some wood build stupid stuff. Nice and simple.

    GTA 5 ONLINE PLAYLISTS

<p class="articleParag">
    Sumo, stunt races, face2face, cars vs rockets, deadline. Such good memories with friends. Would deffinetly want 
    to exprience these for the first time again.
</p>
<h1 class="articleTitle">BURNOUT LEGENDS+DOMINATOR (PSP)</h1>
<p class="articleParag">
    BURNOUT LEGENDS: <br>
    Tbh one of the best arcade racing exprience you could have on your mobile phone(played these the ppsspp). 
    Speeding down thru USA Downtown Rev. with SUPER TYPE 1 is one hell of a exprience. The career starts pretty 
    boring but halfway thru the "muscle" chapter shit starts to get real. Also the crash mode is pretty cool but 
    the lack off multipliars make some events realy difficult. I couldn't 100% the crash campaign.
    <br><br>
    BURNOUT DOMINATOR: <br>
    born to be dominatod by goth momy forced to dominate the traffic ðŸ˜”. 
    <br><br>
    Focusing more on the racing/styling more than taking people down compared to legends, dominator offers 
    a quite uniqe exprience. The career was pretty fun! The lack of a crash mode is quite dissapointing but still 
    these games were there when I needed them the most so I can't complain. Don't listen to what other people saying 
    this game is mid. I mean it kinda is but isn't idk its wierd.
</p>
<h1 class="articleTitle">GRAND TURISMO (PSP)</h1>
<p class="articleParag">
    Entering the car dealer with 400K credits in the bank feels like entering a candy shop with your palms full.
    The main reason I like this game is the driving, this is one of the best <s>""sim""</s> grounded-handling expriences 
    you'll get on mobile. But you do need to get a bit sporty car for it to become engaging most low power cars just 
    understeer. My fav track is Autum Park and Laguna Seca btw.
