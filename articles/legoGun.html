<h1 class="articleTitle">lego gun tutorial</h1>
<p class="articleParag">Hey its me from the third day of the holiday and I am already running 
    out of ideas to write about so today I dicaded that I'll share some of my cool lego work in here
</p>

<h1 class="articleTitle">Let's start with the pros/cons of it.</h1>
<p class="articleParag">
    Pros:
    <br>
    <br>
    -- Powered by 2 rubberbands wrapped around thierself providing itself the power to shoot heavier objects with greate
    accuracy.
    <br>
    <br>
    --The trigger mechnanism is consistent and has a good feel to it.
    <br>
    <br>
    --Requires next to none technic parts and if you get a bit more creative I definetly can see that a household
    item alternative for that pin.
    <br>
    <br>
    Cons:
    <br>
    <br>
    --The loaded object can fall from the barrel if you point down the gun.
    <br>
    <br>
    -- After each shot you need to press bricks together to not get them loose(because of the power the gun stores after each shot the bricks gets loosened a bit)
    <br>
    <br>
    -- The trigger mechanism can brake time to time expact to open and fix the thing fairly often.
    <br>
    <br>
    -- Might be demaging the technic pin a bit (not sure)
</p>

<h1 class="articleTitle">Let's take a look inside the thing.</h1>

The mechanism is very primitive and easy to understand, first lets start with the part that actualy launches the bricks.
It's a 2x4 brick with two 2x6 plates atteched on top of in a wing form also the 2x6 have a smooth 2x2 plate on top of them too(see pic 1.2)
two rubberbands pull it towards the exit of the barrel from it's wings. Note that the lenght of the barrel will depand
on the type of rubberband you use. I recommand that your barrel lenght target to be around the tearing point of the rubberband that you use.
Also 2x4 brick for the launcher isn't mendotory I can see it being a 2x6 or 2x3 maybe even a 1x4(don't think this will be very stable).
<br>
<br>
Now I am going to explain how the trigger mechanism works. Basicly the launcher brick gets locked in place by a technic pin(visiable in pic 1.3) that 
you push in when you pull the 2x4 back. The pin stays in place and doesn't fall down because the force(to see the whole trigger contraption see pic 1.6 and 1.7) its facing from the 
2x4 (so it never leaves the state of static friction and doesn't fall). When you <s>pull</s> push in the trigger(trigger placement can be seen in pic 1.6) the technic 
pin gets pushed down too leaving the 2x4 free.

<h1 class="articleTitle">Additional tips:</h1>
<p class="articleParag">
    To reduce the friction to minimum in the barrel I have left a single plate gap on top of the 2x4 except the part
    that it stays when its being held by the pin there is 2 reasons behind that(see pic 1.2).
    <br>
    <br>
    -- since the pin is pushing the brick from the bottom we don't want it to wobble around the place so I didn't leave a gap for 
    it(see pic 1.2) thats the reason we have a smooth plate on top of the 2x4.
    <br>
    <br>
    -- Also it does kinda help with the trajectory of the projectile by a bit by straigtining the path of 2x4 by a bit.
</p>

<h1 class="articleTitle">How to actualy use it:</h1>
<p class="articleParag">
    Step 1: Pull the 2x4 launcher all the way back.
    <br>
    <br>
    Step 2: While you still hold the 2x4 at the back engage in the technic pin by pushing it in forward.
    <br>
    <br>
    Step 3: Push in the green brick to disenage the pin and realese the 2x4.
