like stuff recently have been realy de-motivating,

<br>
<br>

I don't even know what it is thats bringing me down,
I have nothing on my back but still its still enough to bring me down. I wish that people around me did similar stuff
it would be realy motivating , if i were realy good at a video game like valorant people would be more amazed than me 
saying that I have a blog website and a few small projects/games. Like man if there were 5 of myself in a team I(we?) would
be able to create wonders man.

<br>
<br>
Also I was recently thinking  would people willing to pay for a website like this please contact me if you have exprience about this stuff?
