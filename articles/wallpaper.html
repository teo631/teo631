<h1 class="articleTitle">Trivia!</h1>
<p class="articleParag">
    The car in the picture <i>was</i> supposed to be futured in TI2 as one of the high end cars, I even had 
    the livery for it finished. 
    Since TI2 was <a target="_blank" href="/article.html?project=ti2isKill">brutaly killed with no remorse</a> recently this is the only public apperence this car will likely make besides 
    <a target="_blank" href="/article.html?project=cpm2_d1">CPM2</a> if that game ever becomes a thing.
