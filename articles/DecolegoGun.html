<h1 class="articleTitle">Decorative lego handgun with cosmetic functions tutorial</h1>
<p class="articleParag">It is me,back again yet with a another bizzare creation.
    A creation that will surely bring flavor to shelf of your choise. 
</p>

<h1 class="articleTitle">Brief of the decoration:</h1>
<p class="articleParag">
    Primary functionlity is a mag realise mechanism controlled by a slide hold by rubberbands.
</p>

<h1 class="articleTitle">How to actualy use the mechanism:</h1>
<p class="articleParag">
    In order to act like you are reloading the decoration;<br>
    <br>1. Pull the slide back in order to make the mag move freely inside its dedicated bed.
    <br>
    <br>2. Pull the mag back on the HORIZONTAL AXIS(THIS IS IMPORTENT, DONT PULL DOWN VERTICLY) using your thumb and index finger of your opposite hand that is gripping the deco in order to get the mag to a free fall.
    <br>
    <br>Now you have the mag out, you have a few paths to fallow along depending on which way of looking badass fits your taste better.
    <br>
    <br>The 1. way: This may be the most optimal way if you have a rubber band installed.
    <br>1.1 Put the slide on the resting position.
    <br>1.2 Whilst holding the slides rear with the tumb of your dominant hand, locking it on the horizontal axis, push the mag up.
    <br>1.3 Stop pushing when you feel that the mag has been locked in place by the slide.
    <br><br>The 2. way: Preferable if you don't have a rubber band in the equation.
    <br>2.1 Make sure the slide is pulled back, you can easly achive this by pointing the barrel up if you dont have a rubber band installed.
    <br>2.2 Push the mag in untill you are met with resistance from the top of the slide blocking the mag.
    <br>2.3 Push the slide back in the engaged position to secure the mag in place.
</p>

<h1 class="articleTitle">Assebmly of the decoration in question:</h1>
<p class="articleParag">
    It is made out of 3 primary components: 
    <br><br>
    The base,<br>
    The slide,<br>
    The slide holder,<br>
    <br>
    Here are how you can construct each component: 
    <br><br>
    The base, see pic 1 and 2: Just have a smooth platform for the slide and a 2x3 hole for the mag you should decide the scale 
    of them grip depending on your palm size. You may increase the mag size if you have gigantic hands however I haven't tested how well the slide mechanism would hold up for the weight/size increase of the mag.
    <br><br>
    The slide isn't that complex either you can just make a long box with no filling for one. The critical part is that you must have a 2x2 reverse wedge at the back to make the mag insertion mechanism more convienient to oparate. 
    One optional thing that adds a lot to the overall charm of the decortaion is leaving a shell ejection hole so you can see the mag when the slide is pulled back.
    Don't forget to incorprate necesery changes on the slide holder if you opt in into including the shell ejection hole.

<h1 class="articleTitle">TRIVIA!</h1>
<p class="articleParag">
    -This is probly the earlies Lego creation I have assembled that is actualy still incontanct. The first 
    version dates back around 6 years wilst the final version can be traced a year after that. Btw the design is
    compleaty mine. No outside influnce. Still makes me wonder how did I come up with such design as a primaryschool student.
    Man I did realy peek around those times pre-covid.

    -I am writing this because I am EXTREAMLY bored and have nothing better to do. Only a day is left untill I go home but this week has 
    destroyed all my motivation do anything and left me apathetic and upset for no reason. It realy had to be in a time
    where I have had actualy picked up some positive momentum. :( Also I haven't actualy finished this article because I still 
    need to take and upload the pictures of the decoration here.
</p>

<h1 class="articleTitle">(off-topic) Future blog post content discussion</h1>

    As I stated above I have very little motivation left to do much as of late. But in a close time frame I realy want 
    share more ""art"" related stuff. More renders, sketches since they are much more. They ain't much but they actualy 
    motivates me more than committing into full sized projects since I don't have much free time these days.
