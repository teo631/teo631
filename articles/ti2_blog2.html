<h1 class="articleTitle">Welcome to the second blog post about Traffic Inspectors 2!</h1>
<p class="articleParag">
    Hello!
    Today I laid the foundation of the career mode,
    <br>
    <br>
    Here is an small explanation on how it will work:
    <br>
    <br>
    The way you buy cars(or paint it, change its rims), chose "missions" or "races" will be set 
    out like grand turismo titles,
    a hub where you chose locations. This will help younger people 
    (this game is for primary schoolers btw) understand it easier.
    <br>
    <br>
    You will earn credits by particpating in races and completing missions.
    <br>
    The further you progres the harder the events will become/sticter the timer will be
    (I will have to add some type of system where if you fail an event way to many times it gets easier)
    (Yes the races will have rubberbanding also the oppenents will hit their brakes just before 
    the finish line if its going to be a close finish).
    <br>
    <br>
    (Note: By missions I mean stuff like go from point A to be without breaking any traffic laws)
    <br>
    A faster car will be neccesery for late events becuase the oppenent performance will increase later on your career.
    <br>
    <br>
    But this brings a problem, if player spends too much on buying rims/paint jobs he/she will run out of credits.
    I need a way to limit 
    the spending on these spendings but I am not sure which way I should follow. I will probably drown the player in credits
    and unlock stuff after finishing a particler event. This way the player will always have enough money.
    <br>
    <br>
    Also I will try to speedrun this game after it comes out.
