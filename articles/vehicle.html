<h1 class="articleTitle">Hey its me again</h1>
<p class="articleParag">
    In case that I wasn't realy open about it, I am kinda into cars. Not that much actualy, I just find them kinda cool.
    <br>
    <br>
    Today I am going to be talking about what I learnt whilst trying to understand their physics principles. 
    <br>
    (Edit from 3 days later as of writing the line above.) So it turns out it will actualy take pretty long to fully explain 
    the knowledge that I want to share. Because of that I will split it into multiple parts and explain them one by one in diffirent blog posts.
    This post we will primarly focus on spring components.
    <br>
    (WARNING: this isn't a tutorial. Information here may be incorrect. This is just what I understood/didn't understood of them. )
    <br>
    (TL;DR: i have no idea of what i am doing)
</p>

<h1 class="articleTitle">The part that I understood the best compared to other parts: SPRINGS & ROLLBARS</h1>
<p class="articleParag">
    You know the things that go boing? They follow a simple rule (shout-outs to Robert Hooke for finding this formula).
    "x" is the travel distance of the spring and the "k" is the constant/stiffnes also don't forget delta time since this is a 
    continious force.
    <br>
    <br>
    <code style="background-color: rgb(48, 48, 48); width: 100%;">
        f=-xk*△t
    </code>
    <br>
    <br>
    Tip: Don't forget to clamp the spring force so it doesn't go into the negatives.Spring cant pull the car down!(Unless you have your wheels glued to ground or something).
    <br>
    <br>
    But when we apply this to our car you will see that the car is bouncing in place. To fix that we need to dampen the springs.
    We just need to subtract the travel distance since last step multipled by our damping stiffnes. x for the spring size and k for the damper stiffnes.
    Note that we are not using delta time here since this is a action-reaction type of function. 
    <br>
    <br>
    <code style="background-color: rgb(48, 48, 48); width: 100%;">
        f_damper=-△x*k
    </code>
    <br>
    <br>
    Well lets get into rollbars. You might not understand their purpuse rn and see them as "unnecesery". Youc can always see 
    the lateral friction part and come back later.
    <br>
    <br>
    Lets start. x<sub>1</sub> is the lenght of the right spring on the axel. x<sub>2</sub> is for the right spring.
    <br>
    <br>
    <code style="background-color: rgb(48, 48, 48); width: 100%;">
        rollbarForce=(x<sub>1</sub>-x<sub>2</sub>)*k*△t
        <br>
        if isRightWheelOnAir==false:
        <br>
        (apply force "rollbarForce*(up direction of left wheel)")
        <br>
        if isLeftWheelOnAir==false:
        <br>
        (apply force "rollbarForce*(up direction of right wheel)*-1")
    </code>
    <br>
    (Note: you might need to tweak this a bit since I am writing it from memory atm.)
</p>
<h1 class="articleTitle">
    since we are done with the "The struggle of understanding vehicle physics" part lets move onto the "struggles of pretty much everything else"</h1>
<p class="articleParag">
    Since I have shooken of people with lower attention span at the first chapter of this post I can talk more about personal stuff. Please don't immidetly click off.
    Had one of the most peacefull holidays I have had and I don't regret a second of it. I have so many things to talk about rn so lets go topic by topic.

    <br>
    <br>
    1. School 
    <br>
    <br>
    I realy don't wanna go there. But the worst part is that I have to in order to have a 
    financial freedom in the future.
    Some days feel like going to hell and back. At best it just feels bland. The education is okay at best , its just 
    topic memorazation over and over again. If the school day is 8 hours, about four to five hours of that is wasted time.
    Because It's filled with stupid classes that you litteraly don't do anything meaningfull in for eg: 
    music(2x),pe(2x),english (4x),litirutre(6x),IT (1x),religion(2x),"climate" (2x), chemistry(2x)(more on chemistry later.).
    almost 20 hours a week. Some weeks even more than that. If we include the stupid "performace" homeworks that your 
    teachers give you because they are legaly obliged thats roughly shaving a day of your week AND deleting the 
    part of the day where you are supposed to go out and socialize.Who will pay me compensation for this? Like literaly 
    who????????? I didn't do anything wrong and I am the victim here, so clearyl I need some form of "compensation " for this.
    Also I haven't yet touched the worst part of it:"the exam week". This is the part where the feeling of going to hell and back 
    realy makes you feel it. No words can explain the despair, the anxiety  I have felt. That period in time is the primary reason   
    behind my physchological issiues. Even if you do good in it nobody cares and will ever care. Wish you that you could protest this kind of stuff but
    but you know "Everybody wants to change the world but nobody wants to die.". The worst part is the only thing that school gave me is 
    the ability to crush myself under my own expectations and crumble apart when faced against a task endures me a slightest bit of anxiety.

    <br>
    <br>
    2. The supposed website re-disgn 
    <br>
    <br>
    I have been thinking about it for a while now and i think I have decided that I'll prob switch of to green with a 
    theme selector (you can see the necesery infrastructure changes at the index.css file).
    As for the insparations for the redisgn here are some examples with a similar color pellate.

    <br>
    3. Cycling
    <br>
    <br>
    So in span of 2 weeks I have gained the habit of cycling early in the morning! Which helps me a lot and is a
    nice way to start my week.Rides are fairly eventfull. For example I nearly rear ended a parked Mitsubishi Colt today while going 
    downhill at full speed, got chased by stray dogs last week and I am not going mention all the close calls I had while going fast.
    This is probably the most positive paragraph you'll read in this post.
    <br>
    <br>
    4. Future project plans
    <br>
    <br>
    Wtf am I going to do with all this vehicle knowledge? Td2 turned out to be a project that I am kinda proud of, car paint masters 2 will surely 
    perform better than the first one, after cpm2(in a far future) I'll make another filler title to learn more expect a 
    shitty platformer racer(kinda like gta5 stunt races). After that I'll have my first take on a magnum opus. 
    Theme: An eery thrilling racer that will make you feel like your legs are burning. Taking place in a dystopian near-future
    city drowning in gray concrete and covered in contrasting red with a gloomy atmosphere. Expect this to be relised in around 5 years. Realy excited for this one,hope it 
    stays in the near future instead of current time. Also I am thinking about a Roblox <s>title</s> "place". A race track 
    with vehicles that I made. I can host events like ff cup, supercar cup maybe even endurence races. That could be cool.
    <br>
    <br>
    5. Succses?
    <br>
    <br>
    How do you define "succses"? The sens of accomplisment that you get from yourself? 
    Maybe the gratifaction that you receive from others in form of amazement? Or even some sort of compansation for all the 
    hours you spent? For me its none of these(at least for now). As all of the stuff you see me do here is a coping mechanism to fill the emptyness inside of me.
    I have yet never seen any sort of (positive)diffirence doing this type of stuff. When I sucseed in something that I am 
    naturaly good at nobody cares but when other people are succsesfull at something it becomes the norm.(This sounds realy stupid but think on this one a bit.)
    <br>
    <br>
    6. Were my expectations of school correct? (Will answer this after the first day of school of this semester. Good night) 
    <br>
    <br>
    Hello its me from 8pm next day and I was absolutely correct with my expectations. The day was absolutely empty ,
    devoid of any sense of progression and accomplisment. A day where you are at a net loss, both mentaly and physicly.
    Physicly, feel like my body is rotting away with my head on my desk. I want to spring into some activites but there 
    isn't any cool activites in my school. I wish there were running competitions since it is the the thing that I am slightly above average.
    Mentaly, its realy exousting and it makes me feel empty.  
    I am not excited for tomorrow except the part 
    where it ends. Maybe a bit for the bike ride when I come home? Will try to tightin the brakes of my brake a bit as they are kinda 
    loose and prevent me from pushing hard. 
    <br>
    <br>
    7. So what now?
    <br>
    <br>
    I haven't actualy finished the "vehicle physics" side of this post neitherd do I have the motivation for to do so. I realy don't want 
    to finish talking in here. I don't wanna end writing this. There is so much stuff and things to wory about yet they won't mean a thing at
    the end. If you don't do them you will face the agonizing regret of never trying. What will change when I press the 
    "Push origin" button? Why even read? Did you read this post? I mean for real did you realy read all the paragraphs above 
    trying to understand them or treated them as scrambled array of words representing no meaning and skipped them trying to 
    find the dopamine hit that our brains seek to cope with all the noise. Even a small sip of freedom is enough for me to crave for more.
    A crave with no result.
    <br>
    <br>
    9. Just a few paragraphs?
    <br>
    <br>
    Feels like its been eternity while I have been writing all this yet you can just scroll up and down the page in mere 
    seconds. The best way to define my current state of feeling is saying something that you thought would be cool/leave a big impact 
    at the situation that you are in but it just makes you feel awkerd.
    <br>
    <br>
    10. Did writing this help me?
    <br>
    <br>
    It kinda did. Now I feel slightly bit lighter and my field of view has increased 
    outside of few problems I have right now I am going to take a shover, publish this and log off. Maybe listen to some music later.
    <br>
    <br>
    Bonus topic: "Friendship test"
    <br>
    <br>
    So recently I overheard people talking behind my deck about "friendship" test scores. I asked them what it is 
    and they said it is a thing that you put a link in your instangram bio. Sounds like a cool concept. Why nobody takes my 
    friendship test then? You just passed the test with a score of 100 out of 100 btw.
    <br>
    lets close it with a cool quote:
    <br>
    <br>
    <i>"Divided we stand, together we fall."</i>
</p>
