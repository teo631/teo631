Like what type of choises you have to make in order to be in left in this position.
I you were to describe my current state to my pastself thats starting highschool 
I would be saying that you are bullshitting me. Shit just fell from the skies in front of my eyes.

Soooooo, what are we doing here tonight? ;) We're going to be discussing a wide array of topics
ranging from poetry to my acedemic state to great struggles of web development.

<h1 class="articleTitle">Let's use poetry as a kicker for this post.</h1>
<p class="articleParag">
    "You don't like poetry what happened?" 
    <br>
    <br>
    As you remember I made promises that if something good were ever to happen I would 
    write poetry. I am man of my words.  Even tho you could argue that those things 
    were me just taking calculated risks and me making best of a the things I have.
    But got to give credit where its due, I was pretty lucky. SO I need to fullfill my promise of writing 
    a poem here. 
    <br>
    <br>
    Idk where to start. What does even count as poetry?
    <br>
    <br>
    <i>"Poetry is a type of literature that conveys a thought, describes a scene or tells a story in a concentrated, lyrical arrangement of words."</i>
    <br>
    <br>
    uhhhhh... Can I like... pass song lines as poetry? Idk.
    <br>
    <br>
    o o o before we start; I want to let you know that I have diffuclitys in expressing my sincere emotions.
    I can't get realy get... <i>what do you call it...</i> "think like I am going to be taken seriously and not regret the stuff I just did". 
    Man this sounds bad.
    <br>
    <br>

    That left you in wrath.<br>
    <br>
    <br>
