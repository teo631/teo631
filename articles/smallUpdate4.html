<h1 class="articleTitle">Here with my old friend the silence ,in the end.</h1>
<p class="articleParag">
I have no clue whats going on OR how I ended up here. 
Like what type of choises you have to make in order to be in left in this position.
I you were to describe my current state to my pastself thats starting highschool 
I would be saying that you are bullshitting me. Shit just fell from the skies in front of my eyes.
<br>
<br>
Soooooo, what are we doing here tonight? We're going to be discussing a wide array of topics
ranging from poetry to my acedemic state to great struggles of web development.
</p>
<h1 class="articleTitle">Let's use poetry as a kicker for this post.</h1>
<p class="articleParag">
    "You don't like poetry what happened?" 
    <br>
    <br>
    As you remember I made promises that if something good were ever to happen I would 
    write poetry. I am a man of my words.  Even tho you could argue that those things 
    were me just taking calculated risks and me making best of a the things I have.
    But got to give credit where its due, I was pretty lucky. SO I need to fullfill my promise of writing 
    a poem here. 
    <br>
    <br>
    Idk where to start. What does even count as poetry?
    <br>
    <br>
    <i>"Poetry is a type of literature that conveys a thought, describes a scene or tells a story in a concentrated, lyrical arrangement of words."</i>
    <br>
    <br>
    uhhhhh... Can I like... pass song lines as poetry? Idk.
    <br>
    <br>
    o o o before we start; I want to let you know that I have diffuclitys in expressing my sincere emotions.
    I can't get realy get... <i>what do you call it...</i> "think like I am going to be taken seriously and not regret the stuff I just did". 
    Man this sounds bad.
    <br>
    <br>
    The way of the mind<br>
    Leaves you untied<br>
    <br>
    (wtf am i doing)
    <br><br>
    As you depart the ones<br>
    That left you in wrath.<br>
    <br>
    <br>
    Okay chat gpt said it was alright.Promise fullfilled, not that disasterous for a first try. Do I regret it? My past self 
    would, I am way too down the rabbit hole now :3.
</p>
<h1 class="articleTitle">The axems are next week.</h1>
<p class="articleParag">
   I fear the worst, I fear the sorrows, I fear. Wtf am I doing? Can you help me? No you can't. 
   Am I doomed? Idk. Nobody cares if I make it out anyways. This is going to be a interesting week 
   of me trying to keep my relations in a good state whilst trying to not brakedown under immense pressure.
</p>
<h1 class="articleTitle">The struggles of web devolepment (w/ a limited budget ofc)</h1>
<p class="articleParag">
    First off all, FUCK YOU WHY DO I NEED TO GET AN AC TO SIGN MY SSL CERT. IN ORDER TO USE GEOLOCATION 
    ON MY PHONE??? WHY??? FUCK YOU.
</p>    
<h1 class="articleTitle">Hey it's me back from a mounths a later(I assume)</h1>
<p class="articleParag">
    It's been realy strange lately the exams are over. I managed to pull of another set of good grades. But who cares?
    Do you? You're not happy with yours. Idk how to explain this but having somewhat okay grades makes you feel "unrelatable".
    You know it's not the "cool kids" thing, you don't see memes where it is assumed you got good grades. Not like 
    anybody is going to over-anylize this kind of stuff and get thierself upset over it. Realy I feel empty rn. 
    The weather is like hell here which makes it so that you can not hangout with your friends properly. 
    <br>
    I still have a few ambutions left one of which I am the most excited yet the most uncertain. I have a big 
    plan for friday started the setup like 3 weeks ago I hope I am able to execute it proparly. Wish me best of luck.
</p>
<h1 class="articleTitle">The state of offBeat</h1>
<p class="articleParag"> 
    So I managed to accses geoLocation I just had to use ngrok for a secure connection. AND I FUCKING MANAGED TO CREATE
    A SHITTY REPLICA OF BeatLink!!!!!!! Like this is REALY FUCKING COOL. The people that I showed this weren't impressed
    like whaaaat??????? DUDE IT'S THE FUCKING BEATLINK??? HOW COOL IS THAT? You can post your times to a global leaderboard
    and race those times, shit is real. I gues I am the only one that cares. 
    If you are interested in it just contact me I'll hook you up.You'll also have accses to some of my rare find archives(hard to find pirated video games, open source projects and various other services. ).That sounded like I am trying to deal you drugs. lol.

    May+June sketches
</h1>
<p class="articleParag">
    So doing dumb edgy+shitty sketches turns out to be a realy <i>soothing</i> exprience which I find myself 
    returnig to every once a while (hell even got one of them drawn on my arm with an eye-liner one time, long story tho :3 ). 
    I am not going to comment on all of these but I realy want to talk about is the one with "hair" coming outside of its eye socket and mounth.
    
    <br>
    <br>
    First off all I am going to ask if it is apparent that the things floving out is "hair". I tried adding a hair-tie 
    in order to convey it is hair but idk how you might interprate it.
    <br>
    <br>

    <br>
    <br>
    As for the meaning of it. Ever felt just dumping all your thoughts in an Instangram DM you know how you've been <i>
    feeling</i> lately? Did you? Even as a Intrusive
    thought? I did. But I didn't do so because I know that it will <b>leave the taste of chewing a bundle of hair</b> every 
    time I think about it in the future. Like idk instead I write those thoughts in here. I find texting realy limiting 
    as a form of comunication. I don't get how some people are able to hold converstaions there for hours on end! As I said before numerous times before 
    my prefered way of comunication is via e-mail. Ik thats strange but think about it. You have time to procces, think and 
    express yourself proparly with the conveinces that computer provides in terms of text editing which a paper and pen 
    combination lacks. However good luck convincing people to move over to using e-mail instead of Instangram for comunicating 
    with you. :(

   Trying to play the guitare
</h1>
<p class="articleParag">
    So recently I asked a friend to teach me basics of the playing the guiter which 
    he kindly did so. That's realy cool. I now can play the first part of "Demolation Lovers"
    and a shitty version of the into of "Angles with dirty faces". One thing that caught my 
    attention is that when my parents noticed they said that do I want to be signed up for a guitare
    course. WOW. Like WOW. Instead of asking me what am I playing/why am I playing you put 
    the matter to "you are gonna do this thing this FUCKING SPECIC WAY IN ORDER TO 
    ENJOY YOURSELF" WHICH IS THE SHORT FOR "WE DO NOT GIVE A FUCK". YOU MISSED MY BIRTHDAY
    FOR DAYS UNTILL I MADE YOU REMEMBER DAYS AFTER IT WAS PAST. YOU STILL DIDN'T GIVE ME.
     A GIFT (JUST GET ME A SMALL KEYCHAIN OR SOMETHING) AND ALL YOU SAY IS "you don't know life" 
     WELL FUCK YOU. YOU TELL ME TO PICK MY GIFT THAT'S NOT HOW IT WORKS. "We don't know your interests!"
     YES YOU SHOULD BE CONCERNED YOUR CHILD VENTS ABOUT HIS FEELINGS IN THE INTERNET IN HIS SHITTY LITTLE 
     CORNER OF COURSE YOU DON'T KNOW MY INTEREST I AM YOUR FUCKING CHILD WDYM YOU DON'T HAVE A CLUE. Lately I have 
     started to think that I am not the problem here. 
</p>

<h1 class="articleTitle">Closing off</h1>
<p class="articleParag">
Also it is confirmed that TI2 is dead. I come to fully accept it. It was a fun exprience. Farewell TI2.
<br>
<br>
Also about the lack of new posts here; <s>I can not take it anymroe</s> Have been dedicating my time to offBeat and 
BeatLink recently also to the afformentioned "big plan on friday (please luck be on my side for one time)". Soon will 
do another "7 days 5 posts" week like I did last time break, I need to update the music recomandations page, put out the 
lego revolver tutorial etc.
