<h1 class="articleTitle">Hey hello take a seat.</h1>
<p class="articleParag">
    Recently I have been feeling realy pressured by forces out of my controll and the fact that <s>impending doom</s>
    exam week is apparouching has made me realy anxious on top of that. 
</p>
<h1 class="articleTitle">Let's talk about the game</h1>
<p class="articleParag">
Well this one is a "comfort" title. It won't be greate. The sole purpouse of it is to calm me down and make me have 
something to hold onto sice TI2 has one foot on the gutter. The game have a sandbox focus with a small story mode 
kinda acting like a extensive tutorial. Yes it will be playeable with your friends.
</p>
<h1 class="articleTitle">The story?</h1>
<p class="articleParag">
    I will not go the cheap "horror" route. Expect a difficult adventure with a dreadfully calm narrative.
    I want the exprience be like my certain type of dreams. Some random memorable remote location in form of 
    places that I visit regularly. Unnervingly calm places. This is as far as I can go without giving spoilers 
    about the plot I have laid out so for.
    It is not like I have fully directed the thing too, all this might change in the blink of an eye.
</p>
<h1 class="articleTitle">Sandbox??????</h1>
<p class="articleParag">
Hmmmmm. I wonder what the sandbox will be about. It must be realy difficult to guess. 
<br>
<br>
The primary insparation is "Metalworks Sandbox Demo" by Defaultio. That guy has some banger work. Also has
similar narrative direction that I want to go for in his works. You might even see me hosting events on it if I manage to 
my vision reality.

<h1 class="articleTitle">About CPM2</h1>
<p class="articleParag">
    Yeaaaaa about that. I don't know. Is it worth it? I don't want to create a pattern here. CPM1->TI1 failure. TI2->CPM2 ???.
    What do you think? Well of course you don't think. Who does so am I right? Might even drop this project because how 
    disconnected it makes me feel. The absence of sympathy and abundance of carelessnes from sources one might expect to recive the most 
    support from realy demotivates me from commiting into big projets or long term goals.  
</p>
<h1 class="articleTitle">Conclusion</h1>
<p class="articleParag">
    Why did I make this post If I am going to be so secretive about it? The post about the death of TI2 was getting 
    way too lenghtly for what it is, so I had to make a new post to vent out some more "negative energy" whilst not feeling 
    like I am beating a dead horse and wanted it to not just me venting out negative thoughts so I announced this game that I want to be pretty secretive about. 
    Also I want to remind that these posts realy help me cope with the stress of school. I would realy appricate 
    it if you wish me good luck.
