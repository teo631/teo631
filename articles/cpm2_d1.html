<h1 class="articleTitle">Car Paint Masters 2: A sequel we didn't deserve and definetly didn't need (nor we'll ever need).</h1>
<p class="articleParag">
    First of all thank you for showing up. 
    This post will be the second post of me writing an article every day for five days straight.
    <br>
    <br>
    Lets get to the main topic "CAR PAINT MASTERS 2". For me car paint masters stands inbetween being a tech demo and 
    an actual game. Reason for that is that I made the first game to learn about unity and prove that I can put out
    a meaningfull project/game. Even tho the practices I have used in the first game were not that ideal it did come 
    together pretty well as a shitty hypercasual mobile game.
    <br>
    <br>
    As for the sequel (ill be refering it to as cpm2), I don't where I'll take it I have finished remaking stuff
    from the first game to be optimized for the sequel ,like the car handeling and realy basic gameplay, but don't know
    if I should aim for it to be more revolationary or just an layer of polish on top of the first game.
    <br>
    <br>
     I want to talk about some mechanics I can't realy decide where I should add 
     them or not but first I will talk about the main issues the first game had.

    So the biggest problem with the first game was people not understanding the goal of the game and how the controlls worked.
    I have addresed the issue with the controlls and prob will adress the difficulty in understanding the goal of the game soon.
    <br>
    <br>
    Another problem was the lack of levels and difficulty balencing. 
    As far as I recall there were 25 levels in the first game which would become quite repetetive for a longterm player
    (like if it had any :| ) and none of those levels were forgiving in terms of difficulty if the hard to understand controlls didn't
    get you the difficulty of the levels would sure stop you right on your tracks.
    <br>
    <br>
    Rest of the problems were not that big but they are still worth a mention. For example the progression was quite weak
    and didn't incorrage the player to grind more also there was a lack of action going on the screen I am planing
    to negate this in the sequal by adding cops/oppenents that try to ram you off the road etc/target you with weapons.

    Anyways it is enough for today expect more posts soon and again thanks for showing up.
