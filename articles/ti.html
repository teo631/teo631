<h1 class="articleTitle">Idea of the Project</h1>
<p class="articleParag">This was a idea to have a chance of winning Tübitak 2204-A Higschool students research competition.(It didn't win :c)</p>
<h1 class="articleTitle">The Gameplay</h1>
<p class="articleParag">
    The game has 2 modes, "race" and "scnerio". I am going to start off with scnerio
    The player starts in a pre-selected vehicle, the objective is to reach a 
    point with out violating any traffic laws
    The player had to obey the traffic lights and the speed limit and not to get off-road if they did they would be 
    warned and had to restart the level(idk what to call it realy) there were also pedastrians and bycicles crossing
    the road. 
    <br>
    <br>
    Now I am going to talk about the "Race" mode
    <br>
    This mode was primarly inspired by <a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/embed/IgDFfIwG9nM?start=35">this</a> game, 
    the player had to answer questions and progres thru areas while competing with other NPC vehicles
    on the way to the finish line they could pick up verious stuff such as sand watch, repair kits, bonus questions and
    nitrous bottles.
    <br>
    <br>
    To progress thru areas you had to stay inside these bubbles and answer the question that popped up in you screen
    the questions were about the stuff that you encounter at the scenerio mode
</p>
<img class="articleImage" src="resimler/ti/buble.png">
<p class="articleParag">
    The medal that player got was determined by the time they got. You could get time discounts by finishing first 
    not hitting any trees, collecting sand watches and correct answers from questions. But you were instantly disqualified
    if you hit roof of your car to ground wrecking your car you can also damege your car decresing its performance by hitting trees and terrarain.

    <br>
    <br>
    Now I'll be talking about what each power up do

<p class="articleParag">
    The player can pick these sand watches to get a time discount, the red one was wort more time
</p>
<h1 class="articleTitle">The wrench(repair kit)</h1>
<img width="128" height="128" class="articleImage" src="resimler/ti/anahtar.png">
<p class="articleParag">
   The player can pick these sand watches to repair their car after the have hit their car to a tree or terrarain
</p>
<h1 class="articleTitle">Bonus question</h1>
<img width="128" height="128" class="articleImage" src="resimler/ti/soruRender.png">
<p class="articleParag">
   The player can pick these question markers to answer adetional questions at the end of the race
</p>
<h1 class="articleTitle">The NoS bottle</h1>
<img width="128" height="128" class="articleImage" src="resimler/ti/nitoŞişesi.png">
<p class="articleParag">
   The player can pick this to recive one more nitrous shot, nitrous increased the performance of you vehicle
   <br>
   <br>
   <br>
   The player also could chose a car and a color before the race started, there were 4 cars a Viper, a Buggati, a Lambo and a 370/350z (the cars had no impact on performance)
   <br>

<h1 class="articleTitle">The futures/development of the game</h1>
<p class="articleParag">
    Idk where to begin for this. I am going to divide this into 3 parts early stages,mid stages
    late stages.<br><br>So the "early" stages of devlopment,I first started making the vehicle handling and the ai
    started creating the map and modeled the cars.
    <br><br>Secondly the "mid" devlopment stages this is the part i made the pick-up items and finished the map and added trees/buildings to it ,
    finished the question logic and ai for the race mode added LODs for better performance
    <br><br>At the last the "late" devlopment stages I made the scenerio mode.
    <br>
    <br>
    Here is pictures of some of the models I have made for the game

<h1 class="articleTitle">About the competition</h1>
<p class="articleParag">
    Well this project got "Eliminated in Pre-Evaluation Phase" with a score of 77/100 
     (80 was a pass to the next phase),
     this did realy upset me a lot like I did try to put out something nice , also I want the point out that 
     one of the local winners of that competition was a hamster that is trained for earthquake rescue like wtf were they
     thinking while declering that as one of the winners? Like was it because of the recent earthqukes that killed 
     <strong>+50K people</strong> (at minimum) what you are going to do? Train thousends of hamsters to lift a person out of
     building rubble this is the stupidest thing I have seen also by declaring this "project" by the local winner you are 
     suggesting that you expect another disaster at this degree again instead of applying proper checks to the buildings.
     <br>
     <br>
     <a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TvEyxoLlqk8">Here is a link</a> to a video about that hamster, you can watch it with subtitles.
