<h1 class="articleTitle">Idea of the Project</h1>
<p class="articleParag">So this was before the relase of Battlefield 2042,I decided my previous battle royale game 
    wasn't going to be more scaleable and add more futures and also the battle royale genre was in a rapid decline 
    I decided to stop development of the battle royale game and start developing a new game.
</p>
<h1 class="articleTitle">The Gameplay</h1>
<p class="articleParag">
    The objective was to capture enemy points while protecting your points.The environment had destructable buildings,
    billboards, statues and cars.The progression was about capturing points and eliminating rivals.You got a new 
    skill/weapon each rank. The game had a tutorial, badges.

<h1 class="articleTitle">Development of the game</h1>
<p class="articleParag">This was a project I did because I was bored I'ts around 240 lines of code, I used 
    Sooo (most) weapons were recycled from my battle royale.The most difficult part of the development was 
    the rank/load-out system, I made them without using spaghetti code so I can scale it easly. Other parts
    of development were quite enjoyable the main menu, skills, destructable objects , the game logic.
    Also I made the thumbnail of the game in Photoshop.
    <br>
    <br>
    Also the development of the game is stopped becuase I couldn't get any traction from social media or any other players
    .The feedback I got from people weren't bad, It wasn't groving because nobody was playing it since its a multiplayer
    game relying on players it could break of the ice.
    <br>
    <br>
    Here is some gameplay of it.

    Special thanks to <a target="_blank" href="https://www.twitch.tv/nightskyylive">Night Sky Live</a> for greatly supporting development of the game.
