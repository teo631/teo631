<p class="articleParag">"Yo dude check this cool app I found, we can finaly play cs1.6 without getting caught"</p>

<h1 class="articleTitle">Objective of the project</h1>
<p class="articleParag">Do you hate when you are in computer class and
    finish writing "hellow world" for the 100 th. time in some wierd visual coding software and decide 
    to play some games on the pc just to be called out to stop playing the game and if you get caught again 
    your grades are going to be effected by that
    beacuse the slight freeze after alt+f4 gave you away?
    <br>
    <br>
    Then fear not! The AltF4++ is for you!
</p>

<h1 class="articleTitle">How to use it?</h1>
<p class="articleParag">
    First, get the app from <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/teo631/altF4plus-derste-oyun-oynama-prog">here</a>
    <br>
    <img class="articleImage" src="resimler/altFolder/step1.png">
    <br>
    <img class="articleImage" src="resimler/altFolder/step1b.png">
    <br>
    <br>
    After that 
    Extract the RAR to a empty folder, run "AltF4++.exe".
    <img class="articleImage" src="resimler/altFolder/step2.png">
    <br>
    <br>
    Now, you are gone see this ui.
    <br> (<strong> ! Importent note ! </strong>: the app will be not visible to avoid getting caught
    on the task bar, if it unfocuses use "ALT+TAB" to bring it up back.)
    <br>
    <img class="articleImage" src="resimler/altFolder/step3.png">
    <br>
    <br>
    Now I am going to explain what does each elemented represented as a number do.
    <br>
    <br>
    1. Element: You need to select the ".exe" file of the game you are going to play
    <br>
    <br>
    2. Element: This is the most important part,this is the image that going to overlay the game, I recommand
    a picture of the desktop if you are playing it on full screen borderless.
    <br>
    <br>
    3. Element: This is a save button (the save is file is going to be created in the same directory as the "AltF4++.exe" file), it saves the currently selected stuff.
    <br>
    <br>
    4. Element: You need to select the save file that the 3. element created to load it.
    <br>
    <br>
    5. Element: Choses the app that you want to open for eg: scratch (check elemnt 6 for context).
    <br>
    <br>
    6. Element: Check the circle that suits you needs best, ("Site aç": Open website,"Uygulama seç": open an app) 
    this is 
    what it does after killing the game procces.
    <br>
    <br>
    7. Element: This is the director that you have chrome is installed, 
    dont have to change this one if you have chrome installed in the deafult 
    directory.
    <br>
    <br>
    8. Element: (check elemnt 6 for context) The url that the app will open after killing the game procces
    if "Site aç" is sellected 
    <br>
    <br>
    Now you know what every elemnt does I am going to tell you how to use the app.
    <br>
    After selecting all the necesery directorys to the image,the game etc you can hit alt+Z to overlay the image on the game
    hitting it again will close it and open the website/app you have selected for it. Here is a video example of it:
