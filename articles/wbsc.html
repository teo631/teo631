<h1 class="articleTitle">Development of the project</h1>
<p class="articleParag">This was a project I did because I was bored I'ts around 240 lines of code, I used 
    Selenium and Discord.net in Visual Studio. The way it works
    is it first loops thru every "player_name" class in the html and puts them in a array 
    then it goes to website/(playerName here) after that it loops through every element again when it finds a stat it wants
    to log it takes the last read value for example: it prints "Wrecks" that means the elemnt before it was the wrecks stat
    so I log it. After all of that i send it to a discord channel here it is in work:
