<h1 class="articleTitle">Why?</h1>
<p class="articleParag">
It is offical TI2 failed 2204-A which means it has got one foot in the grave. Which also means my tech was way too 
impressive for the liberals Tübitak. The only chance TI2 left to survive is Technofest. If it fails at there too I am going to:
<br>
<br>
1. Finnaly have a reason to feel down for extensive periods of time.
<br>
2. Finnaly be able to make extensive hate speech on officals hosting/monitoring the event or any.
<br>
3. Development of TI3 will start.With <b>full</b> creative direction freedom.(You can see the concept icon on the post thumbnail)  
<br>
4. No one will ever be forgiven.
<br>
<br>
No words can express my frustration. One may expect me to be shaking,sobbing and crying yet I feel empty.
Oh my god I want to bomb a place I bet my life on that those middle aged conservative brainwashed cuckold politicians didn't even watch 
the video I linked I bet those fuckers didn't even do research on what it took to do everything in ti2. You may call me 
an idiot as the first game didn't succeed and the actual concept of the project has no point, you would be absulety rigtht. 
Those idiots could at least provide a reason for their conclusion I am left with a fucking ancient user interface spitting
on my face saying that I failed "pre-evalation phase". Hello may I ask why? Hello is anybody thereee????? Couldn't I be 
the "boy in poverty invents [ACTUALY USEFULL SHIT] against all the odds and you should be ashemed for no reason!" in the headlines
but instead I am the stupid introverted skinny middle class boy who wasted many hours of his precios hours on this shit. Man I don't wanne be 
stuck inside a memory I don't wanna keep anymore.
<br>
<br>
I don't even know if I should publish this post I have already wasted 45 minutes writing it and I have reveald far more personal
insecuritys then I am confortable sharing. You know it is hard to keep a line between my personal life and this place.
<br>
<br>
Hey If you are friend of mine entering here for the first time thinking that this website is all like this post where 
I ramble on useless stuff don't be fooled. You can find many great resources and have fun reading thru non-hate filled posts if you look around for a bit more.

<h1 class="articleTitle">Hey it is me after a week letting the information sink in.</h1>
<p class="articleParag">
Am I the victim here ?Or Am I making myself look as such? It heavly depends on your moral compass is laid out. This was a 
pation project trying to mix something that I liked doing into something that would be rewarding in the long run. But 
in the and it looks like I have shot myself on the foot.
<br>
<br>
So while I was writing the last paragraph I remembered that my schools Instangram page posted a picture of 2 students and a teacher in 
a Tübitak exhibiton showcasing their project. They had a few laptops laid in front of them and a huge chunk of text behind them.
So I wondered what was it that got them into bigger leagues but gues what Instangram is down. Why, whyyyyyyyy I am doing 
something that helps me to cope with this kind of stuff and something finds a way to go wrong.  What do I do now? I have found 
the corrage and the inspration to write but the whole momentum I had comes to and instant halt when it was just starting to build up.
<br>
<br>
I have grabbed a snack,walked around the house aimlessly and listened to some music whilst doing so. To my suprize Instangram 
is still down. Somebody at <s>Meta</s> facebook must be shitting thier pants pretty hard. I am happy that I am not in the 
position of that person. Realy lately my only form of relieve myself has been saying "I am realy gratefull that I am 
not in a stuation where [INSERT REALY HORRIABLE STUFF THAT COULD BE TOPIC TO MANY HORROR MEDIA]."
/"I could be suffering [INSERT REALY STRESSFUL STIUATION WITH NO POSITIVE RETURN IN THE END]."
<br>
<br>
Okay I have got my hand on the projects that were inited to the local exhibiton and I will call them out 1by1.Okay lets go. <a target="_blank" href="https://tubitak.gov.tr/sites/default/files/26487/adana_1.pdf">btw here is the list</a>

Omg I just wasted 2 hours trying to clear this pages github commit history and ended up not being able to clear it so i just deleted and created a brand new repo.
Now I have to be realy carefull on what I write in here. Man I should realy get a better host. Also I should update the "My projects" page as it has fallen into irrelevancy since I shifted my focus into the blog page.
