    Just wiped the entire blog post oops silly me while trying to transfer the files to githbub project files :D
    <br>

    So I am going to keep it short. The game is ready in a very short demo like stage, so I need to make a video 
    showcasing it and explaining it
    (sadly in a corporate way) which I don't have the will power to do so atm .Dude I am so
     bored and I always procrastinate on these stupid stuff. Hello its me from a few days later now I have collected enough focus to write 
     this+prepare the video (becuase exams are about to start in a week).

     Hello, its from 2 days later, I have sent the teacher the video  
     <br>

     Hello its me from a few weeks later (I think???) a lot of stuff has happened in a short span of time which was 
     realy tiring for me, this includes the exprience that is the exam week ,which felt like going to hell and back,
     also some other social stuff.

     It's kinda ironic that when I said everything is going to get better stuff starts going downhill realy quickly 
     realy hard. I thought It was going to get better bc I had recived a "sign" 
     (so our religion teacher gives out candy at the end of each lesson there is many colors red/yellow/green/purple
     and he gives out them randomly 1 for each person, so I said to myself that if I and my deskmate get a green and purple 
     combination things will get better and we got a green/purple comb.). This sounds realy stupid doesn't it? Which brings 
     us into our next topic, am I stupid (this sounded better in my head)?????? My academic life is painfuly average.It's
     at a point where im not good in grand scheme of things but kinda nice in scope of my peers in school BUT when we 
     look at the flip side of the coin which is my social life it kinda sucks. Feel like Im realy social awkerd and can't 
     express myself which realy sucks. I don't know the reason behind this, my looks(note that im extreamly skinny with a BMI of 15.7 at 175cm)? My personality?
     For some reason it just doesn't work. 
     <br>

     Any ways, back to the actual topic made a 17min "skech" for the video and the teacher tells me its too long and no one would 
     bare to watch it in full (what do you expect of me It's already a miracle that a stupid 15 year old 
     can pull off a project at this size and make a fully fletced video explain it????Like do you expect me to put
     brain rot family guy/subway surfers clips on the side???). Also I have checked videos that other people have posted for 
     their projects
     look like it was slapped together in 30mins.
