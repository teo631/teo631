    Just wiped the entire blog post oops silly me while trying to transfer the files to githbub project files :D
    <br>

    So I am going to keep it short. The game is ready in a very short demo like stage, so I need to make a video 
    showcasing it and explaining it
    (sadly in a corporate way) which I don't have the will power to do so atm .Dude I am so
     bored and I always procrastinate on these stupid stuff. Hello its me from a few days later now I have collected enough focus to write 
     this+prepare the video (becuase exams are about to start in a week).

     Hello, its from 2 days later, I have sent the teacher the video  
     <br>

     Hello its me from a few weeks later (I think???) a lot of stuff has happened in a short span of time which was 
     realy tiring for me, this includes the exprience that is the exam week ,which felt like going to hell and back,
     also some other social stuff.
     <br>
     <br>
     Any ways, back to the actual topic made a 17min "skech" for the video and the teacher tells me its too long and no one would 
     bare to watch it in full (what do you expect of me It's already a miracle that a stupid 15 year old 
     can pull off a project at this size and make a fully fletced video explain it????Like do you expect me to put
     brain rot family guy/subway surfers clips on the side???). Also I have checked videos that other people have posted for 
     their projects
     they look like they were slapped together in 30mins.
