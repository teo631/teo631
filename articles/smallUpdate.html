    hello as you might have noticed it have been missing and not posting/being active in any 
    platforms. It has been realy stressfull for no reason to me as always and full of <b>"minor"</b> fuck-ups thet were always 
    enough to ruin my day.
    <br><br>
    To escape from all the negativity that I have been exposed to recently I will be speaking about some topics with 
    thier own sub-topics.
    <br><br>

    


</p>
<h1 class="articleTitle">SCHOOL CLASSES</h1>
<br><br>
<p class="articleParag">
    I will rate and talk about the classes that I'm forced to endure every single weekday. Let's start by good old math.
    <br>*this is my point of view on these subjects. Your depiction of same subjects may be diffirent as I probly live 
    in a diffirent country than you.
</p>
<h1 class="articleTitle">MATH</h1>
<p class="articleParag">
    Math, a coin with two sides. One side suggests that It's a form of art, a puzzle ,a new percpective. The other side 
    says that I should kill myself. The second you get grasp of a subject you get slapped in the face with another one. 
    "Hmm the topic of functions is actualy interesting and may yield usefull info" you study functions the next mounth you are left
    heartbroken by polynomials wondering how tf are you going to be able put a pen mark in you exam paper.

<p class="articleParag">
I don't even know what do we do in this one. If you have intrest in such object you might actualy enjoy this one 
also at the same time I think this class is the class with the most wasted potantial. You could it could be a very 
good introduction to creative works and public speech but we are never asigned cool (unstressing) creative works.
Instead it's a small text with a few paragraph about a predetirmined thing with expectations of high quality if you actauly 
get assigned homework since it happens once a blue moon. As for the public speech part, I am not afraid of public 
speech I don't have social anxiety(even tho I am not the most sociable person) I just don't find any reason to get
infront of (mostly) ignorent people who are bored out of their lives and are over all not interested in your neesh subject.
Also sometimes you would be given "recent/modern topics" like gender equality,effects of tech and bla bla. Like no 
I don't find just getting up and making a generic speech about "Gender equality/The refugee problem/The [Insert a problem that has a singuler moraly correct defenitive answer] problem"
Maybe the reason I don't find this class enjoyable because school realy made me fragile ageinst actual responsibilities.
Also special shout-outs to our literature teacher for being such a good harted person whose good intentions get abused constanly
he is the sole reason this class isn't as painfull to go thru. Doesn't this website count as public speech too?

<p class="articleParag">
I just listen to this one since I realy don't think the teacher knows what he is doing and you are prob better of not listening
to the class and just studying the subjects by yourself. You could use the 2 hours to do homework of other classes to 
not waste it or just sleep. As for the actualy subject of chemisty I think the class is very understandable and menageable
in terms of subject difficulty (as far as this year goes).

Even tho I am not attending it this year I did attend it last year.It was a interesting exprience I didn't realy enjoy 
it but it was kinda relaxing.If I did attent it this year and pick up some actual skills from it painting could be a 
an excelent stress reliver and form of self expresion(Imagine an art galery in this website). Replace the teacher with a more likeable person and you got yourself an actualy enjoyable 2 hours.
Don't realy understand why classm8s hate it.

The class that I am attending even tho I didn't want to switch. I was forced to do so because of carelessnes.
Even tho it is much easier than art I still find it insulting how you just write the thing on the board prepare a 
presentation on some random guy that has barely have any info on itself and sing a small part of a song horribly just 
to get a pass and "satisfy" the teacher. The teacher of this class is annoying as the art one too.

It is kinda bareable even tho the education you are getting is kinda subpar and uninteresting this class well could be optional.
Annoying homework. Kinda difficult exam tho.
<br>
<br>

-- EDIT: Well axem results for the first exams of the second semester are rolling in and to my suprise my in-class 
performance grade has been entered. It is 10. What? Wtf did I do? Why???? Like I sabotage the class or something.
I just slept on it and didn't realy join in but was it realy necesery????? If it stays like that fail the class.
And also if you have done this in order to just make me beg and make a promise on getting involved in class more 
than I used to the teacher has realy lost my respect to the class. This is a realy bad way to enforce more interaction
on the class. I am realy dissopointed.

A realy "stupid" exprience don't have much to say on it at best it is mundane and uninteresting at worst cause of "minor 
fuck-ups"(I accidently dropped the fucking computer(not the monitor, it <b>was</b> a shitty office PC that was a singular monitor.) off the desk in the middle of class.)
Also the teacher is annoying.

I don't realy know what to write about it if I write anything positive about it I would be lying to myself. I tried(realy) 
but just can't find anything to do which I don't feel like I am hindering something and being realy passive in it. If people were 
diffirent people maybe I could enjoy this class. Overall it just a mediocer exprience at best. At least I don't
suck at tablet tennis.

You might have guesedthat I don't have any trouble getting thru this class
(Evet siteyi tamamen kendim çeviri kullanmadan yazıyorum. Türkçe yerine ingilizce kullanmamın nedeni sitenin daha erişilebilir olması. ) 
 but it is realy boring with 
stupid homework and the the teacher won't let me sleep.Also has mad potantial to be actualy interesting instead we just 
do grammer and fill in the excersies at the work book.The books might be a2 or b1 but either way it is booooring. Also not to mention the 
stupid kindergarten level books that the teacher threatens everybody with grades to read them.

Somebody will pay me compensation for all off this right? Right??? Hello is anybody there????? What do you mean I should 
be thankfull for it? I am here rotting away on my desk both physicly and mentaly while screaming bloody murder in hopes of being heard.

<h1 class="articleTitle">If everyone mentioned in this list were to read the full thing would I be in trouble?</h1>
<p class="articleParag">
    Maybe. Not sure. How would you even react to it? An assey long complaint about you from a random innocent looking 
    student/friend. I have actualy brought this website into many conversations with close friends on how I run a website where I share 
    my projects and make blog posts and the link to this website has been atteched to my personal instangram account for a good while.
    Even tho it does recive some light(from discord where its also atteched to my status) traffic the average interaction time is realy low which means the evarge visitor leaves after 39secs.
    And the fact that nobody actauly confronted me about the wierd stuff I write here proves the fact that no one cares.
    Imagine the traffic if a girl were to put a link in thier insta bio.
