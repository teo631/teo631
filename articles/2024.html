hello, it's the end of 2023!
<br>
<br>
Feels like I have been thru hell and back. Especialy the mounth surrounding new year(I'm writing this 17 days after 
new years. I wrote total of 2 full drafts for this post but ended up scrapping them.) the exams pushing in on me, 
feeling empty even tho I did good in all of them, social difficulties etc.
<br>
<br>
But!
<br>
<br>
I have got 3 news, two good and one that is kinda neuturel (it leans more into the positive side tho).
<br>
<br>
First of all: NOW I AM FREE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!(for a short period of time at least(*also the way you define free matters too)). 
<br>
<br>
Secondly I am proud to announce that Car Paint Masters 2 has entered its early development stages. You can expect a much 
better product than the first one because the game is being <b>built from the ground up </b>( :] ) with many new cars,
infinite* levels, much more customization and content.
<br>
<br>
And the last of the news is that development of TI2 is going to pause for a few mounths. I have sent the project report to
the competition and there is nothing I can do anymore until the project gets a green light(this was a good one)
if it doesn't I am going to have serious doubts about myself.Am I not compitent? How tf did I manage to mess up this one 
up too? Did I just waste multiple hours at a day of the year that was supposed to be the one the best years of my life?
Why am I this way? Maybe I shouldn't have gone this way. I hope it doesn't end that way.
<br>
<br>
Heyy its me from 3 days later, yesterday I got my report card and no words can express my hate towards school.

First of all that place is extreamly subpar the place feels like a mathcbox made in 2008. It even got frutuger earo
as artwork for some places, thats how outdated it is (no offense to frutuger earo). We haven't even got up to the 
chemistry lab beacuse it has no working equipment. The only activity we do in PE is soccer and table tennis with torn 
up rackets and broken tables(this place is like supposed to be top-end[around %4.5] school in terms of quality).
I hate the place (+the education system). I have been to hell and back to get slightly above average grades and I
actualy got them...
<br>
<br>
(quick explaniton on how "certificats" work here, so there is three of them. The first one is the "Thank you" one 
which you get if your evarage is >75 and if your evarage is >85 you get the "Apriciation" one instead. 
On top of the first certificat you get you can get the "Honor" certificat which has to be manualy assigned and isn't
effacted by your grades.)
<br>
<br>
... but for some unforseen reason I didn't get the honor one(quite lot of people got it in my class), wait before you call me a spoiled nerd, I mean me not 
getting it didn't realy changed anything. I realy don't care but man what the fuck I was lacking in terms of being
a student? You put me thru hell and don't even care to apriciate my hard work. Fuck you go shove that cert. up your ass.
Which means my teachers also didn't see me "refined" enough. If some school offical is reading this because of MY succses
in some area of work, FUCK YOU yes what you heard is right FUCK YOU go shove that cert up your ass. Please take legal action 
against me for insulting you so that the lie you have told gets surfuced and how terrible of a administrator you are 
gets surfuced. I was told that I would get it if I were to participate in national competitions. I did 
<s>spent</s> wasted hours on end trying to put something together and you didn't even care. I hate you.

<br>
<br>

Please note that this hate is towards many instead of one. If you feel offended great you deserve it!
<br>
<br>

What a great way to start my holiday! If you want to argue that my statemets are wrong and not deserved it's pretty 
easy to contanct me, just scroll to the bottom.
<br>
<br>

Also here is some sick car picks.
