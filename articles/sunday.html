<p class="articleParag">
    it's a realy boring sunday so i'll talk about some of the thoughts I had today.

    <br><br>
    You know, I cycle every morning around my neighborhood preferably early in the morning. Today I needed to take and drop something off 
    from my grandparents. Their house is only a few km's far away from my house and there is an actualy ""*bike lane"" going there.
    One thing going there that cought my attention is the how many fucking political adverts is on a singular intersection.
    I counted <b>15</b>(that was in a readable state, not torn apart, from a singular pov) banners in a singular 4 way intersection with some event obstructing turnout so you can't see upcoming vehicles
    (there isn't any traffic lights for that). Graphic desing of the adverts aren't even grate some bland text on red 
    backgrounds mostly maybe even some blue. Wish I could vandalize them in some way. Before telling me that "this is the wrong set of actionst to take"
    remember that those people are activly ruining my life. Only thing that holds me back is that I know that the surrounding
    is being constantly being surveilled there are cameras literaly everywhere and I don't know any spots to get lost (at least yet).

    Also not to mention the loud ass busses that have thier ugly face plastered into it blasting their stupid promotional 
    music(?) out roaming the city. My school doesn't even have toilet paper and functioning flushes and there is these group 
    of people sitting on desks all day riding the lates luxery cars polluting my view with thier ugly faces getting away with it all.

    Do I realy need to get my self purposly get hit by a car and die to raise some consern
     that those banners obstruct and are obsuluty unnecesery waste of plastic pulloting the environment?
     <br>
     <br>
     Like wtf do you even do all day? Build stupid uselles roads, sign some paperwork , print ugly banners and be paid more that majority of the population?
     I hate you.
